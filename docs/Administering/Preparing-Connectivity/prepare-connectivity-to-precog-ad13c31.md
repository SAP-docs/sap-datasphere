# Prepare Connectivity to Precog

To be able to successfully validate and use a connection to Precog for view building certain preparations have to be made.

Before you can use the connection, the following is required:

-   In Precog, you have added the source for which you want to create the connection.

-   In SAP Datasphere, you have added the necessary Precog IP addresses to the IP allowlist. For more information, see [Add IP address to IP Allowlist](add-ip-address-to-ip-allowlist-a3c2145.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > You can find and copy the relevant IP addresses in the final step of the connection creation wizard.
