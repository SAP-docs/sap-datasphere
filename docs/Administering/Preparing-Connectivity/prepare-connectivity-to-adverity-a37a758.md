# Prepare Connectivity to Adverity

To be able to successfully validate and use a connection to Adverity for view building certain preparations have to be made.

Before you can use the connection, the following is required:

-   In an Adverity workspace, you have prepared a datastream that connects to the data source for which you want to create the connection.

-   In SAP Datasphere, you have added the necessary Adverity IP addresses to the IP allowlist. For more information, see [Add IP address to IP Allowlist](add-ip-address-to-ip-allowlist-a3c2145.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > To get the relevant IP addresses, please contact your Adverity Account Manager or the Adverity Support team.
