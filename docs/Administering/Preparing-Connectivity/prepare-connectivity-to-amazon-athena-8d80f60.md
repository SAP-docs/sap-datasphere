## Remote Tables

Before you can use the connection for creating views and accessing data via remote tables, the following is required:

-   A DW administrator has uploaded the server certificates to SAP Datasphere. Two certificates are required, one for Amazon Athena and one for Amazon S3. Region-specific certificates might be required for Amazon Athena.

    For more information, see [Manage Certificates for Connections](manage-certificates-for-connections-46f5467.md).
