## Remote Tables

Before you can use the connection for creating views and accessing data via remote tables, the following is required:

-   An administrator has connected an SAP HANA smart data integration Data Provisioning Agent to SAP Datasphere and registered the CloudDataIntegrationAdapter.

    For more information, see [Preparing Data Provisioning Agent Connectivity](preparing-data-provisioning-agent-connectivity-f1a39d1.md).
