# Enable the Product Switch to Access an SAP Analytics Cloud Tenant

You can link your SAP Datasphere tenant to a SAP Analytics Cloud tenant and enable the product switch in the top right of the shell bar, to help your users easily navigate between them.



## Procedure

1.  Go to *System* \> *Configuration* \> *Tenant Links*.

2.  Enter the URL of your SAP Analytics Cloud tenant.

3.  Click *Save* to confirm the connection.

    > ### Note:  
    > An SAP Analytics Cloud user must create a live connection before they can consume data from SAP Datasphere \(see [Live Data Connections to SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/ad4281e2875949f0b4d45d1072ff4c38.html) in the *SAP Analytics Cloud* documentation\).
    > 
    > Multiple SAP Analytics Cloud tenants can create live connections to your SAP Datasphere tenant, but only one SAP Analytics Cloud tenant can be accessed via the product switch.
    > 
    > For more information about consuming data in this way, see [Consume Data in SAP Analytics Cloud via a Live Connection](https://help.sap.com/viewer/24f836070a704022a40c15442163e5cf/internal/en-US/a2c5486c03174620be9de3c8c769ce54.html "You can create a live connection from SAP Analytics Cloud to SAP Datasphere and consume data exposed as analytic models, perspectives, and views to create stories and analytic applications.") :arrow_upper_right:.
