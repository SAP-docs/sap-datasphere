# Configure the Size of Your SAP Datasphere Tenant

Configure the size of your tenant by specifying resource sizes based on your business needs. Capacity Units \(CU\) are allocated to obtain storage and compute resources for your tenant.

You can configure the size of a subscription-based tenant and a consumption-based tenant with a standard plan.

To do so, you must have an SAP Datasphere administrator role.



<a name="loio33f8ef4ec359409fb75925a68c23ebc3__section_jqc_kwk_zsb"/>

## Configuring the Sizes of Resources

In the *Tenant Configuration* page of the *Configuration* area, you can increase the sizes for the various resources, within the permitted size combinations, to obtain a configuration that fits your exact needs, and then click *Save*.

> ### Caution:  
> Once you save the size configuration of your tenant, some resources cannot be resized later. Storage cannot be downsized. If you require storage downsize, you must recreate the tenant. Exception: If you need to decrease the memory, see SAP note [3224686](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3224686).

Also, once you click *Save*:

-   The whole process could take more than 90 minutes. The configuration process is not long, but the operational process in the background can take a while.

-   In case an error occurs, you are notified that the configuration cannot be completed and that you need to try again later by clicking the *Retry* button \(which replaces the *Save* button in such a case\). The delay depends on the error \(for example, if there is an error on the SAP HANA Cloud database side, you can retry after 60 minutes\).

-   You can only change SAP HANA Compute and SAP HANA Storage once every 24 hours.

-   If you try to change your SAP HANA configuration, SAP HANA Cloud functionality \(Spaces, DPServer, Serving of Queries\) will not be available for around 10 minutes. If you run into issues after the configuration, use the *Retry* button.

These previous copies incur data lake storage costs. For example, you may have a 10 MB table, and the storage will be higher than that because of the number of operations initiated and copied.

## vCPU Allocation

When you set your base configuration, the performance class you select and the hyperscaler you are using determines the amount of memory in GB available for each vCPU in the system. For example, an AWS system with 32 GB of memory has 2 vCPUs, whereas an AWS system with 320 GB of memory has 20 vCPUs. The tables below list the memory to vCPU ratio for each hyperscaler.
