# Configure the Size of Your SAP Datasphere Tenant

Configure the size of your tenant by specifying resource sizes based on your business needs. Capacity Units \(CU\) are allocated to obtain storage and compute resources for your tenant.

You can configure the size of a subscription-based tenant and a consumption-based tenant with a standard plan.

To do so, you must have an SAP Datasphere administrator role.

## Configuring the Sizes of Resources

In the *Tenant Configuration* page of the *Configuration* area, you can increase the sizes for the various resources, within the permitted size combinations, to obtain a configuration that fits your exact needs, and then click *Save*.

> ### Caution:  
> Once you save the size configuration of your tenant, be aware that some resources cannot be resized later. Storage cannot be downsized. If you require a storage downsize, you must recreate the tenant. Exception: If you need to decrease the memory, see SAP note [3224686](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3224686).

Also, once you click *Save*:

-   The whole process may take more than 90 minutes. The configuration process is not long, but the operational process in the background can take a while.

-   In case an error occurs, you are notified that the configuration cannot be completed and that you need to try again later by clicking the *Retry* button \(which replaces the *Save* button in such a case\). The delay depends on the error \(for example, if there is an error on the SAP HANA Cloud database side, you may need to retry after 60 minutes\).

-   You can only make changes to SAP HANA Compute and SAP HANA Storage once every 24 hours.

-   If you try to change your SAP HANA configuration, SAP HANA Cloud functionalities \(Spaces, DPServer, Serving of Queries\) will not be available for around 10 minutes. If you run into issues after the configuration, use the *Retry* button.

## Supported Sizes

To view all supported size combinations for compute and storage resources and the number of capacity units consumed, go to the [SAP Datasphere Capacity Unit Estimator](https://datasphere-estimator-sac-saceu10.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/).

Data lake storage includes data lake compute.

To reduce the size of your data lake storage, you must first delete your data lake instance, and re-create it in the size that you want.

> ### Note:  
> Deletion cannot be reversed and all data stored in the data lake instance will be deleted.

\[optional\] Select the number of compute blocks to allocate to Data Integration applications which provide enhanced data integration capabilities. This comprises the replication flow that enables data integration with delta processing which is the recommended integration solution for all supported source and target systems.

You can increase the number of blocks to assign a maximum of 7200 node hours. You can decrease the number of blocks until you reach the minimum number of node hours included in your plan.

The number of node hours available for Data Integration applications per month is calculated from the number of allocated compute blocks.

Every month you're entitled to running up to 200 hours of jobs. Using more than 200 hours has no impact in other jobs. The consumption of data integration is not limited to avoid interrupting critical integration scenarios, but you will be billed for the overusage when it happens.

*Maximum Parallel Jobs*

</td>
<td valign="top">

The maximum number of parallel jobs is calculated from the number of execution hours assigned. For every 100 execution hours, you are given one extra parallel job, up to a maximum of 10.

Each parallel job means that roughly 5 datasets, from one or several replication flows, can be run in parallel. If more replication flows are running, processing will be queued and replication will occur less frequently.
