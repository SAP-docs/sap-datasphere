# Create OAuth2.0 Clients to Authenticate Against SAP Datasphere

Users with an administrator role can create OAuth2.0 clients and provide the client parameters to users who need to connect clients, tools, or apps to SAP Datasphere.

You can create OAuth2.0 clients with:

-   An *Interactive Usage* purpose:
    -   To use the `datasphere` command line interface \([Log into the Command Line Interface via an OAuth Client](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9b8363ae47c347de9a027c0e5567a37a/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/eb7228a171a842fa84e48c899d48c970.html "If an administrator has created an OAuth client (with Purpose set to Interactive Usage) for datasphere command line interface users to log into, there are several methods for accessing it.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
    -   To consume data via the OData API \(see [Consume SAP Datasphere Data in SAP Analytics Cloud via an OData Service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/43509d67b8b84e66a30851e832f66911/cloud/en-US/9de2c660fd3b4db2b89ad25e584e8857.html "You can create an import data connection in SAP Analytics Cloud to consume data from an asset exposed via the SAP Datasphere OData API and consume it in an SAP Analytics Cloud model.") :arrow_upper_right:\).

-   An *API Access* purpose:
    -   To use the SCIM 2.0 API \(see [Create Users and Assign Them to Roles via the SCIM 2.0 API](../Managing-Users-and-Roles/create-users-and-assign-them-to-roles-via-the-scim-2-0-api-1ca8c4a.md)\).
    -   To transport content through SAP Cloud Transport Management \(see [Transporting Your Content through SAP Cloud Transport Management](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/05383980f0704c71ab9872360ce45622.html "Integrate SAP Datasphere with SAP Cloud Transport Management service to transport content packages across different landscapes.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
