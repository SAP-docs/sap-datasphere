## Enable SAP Business AI

SAP Business AI is integrated to generate AI content recommendations in various areas of SAP Datasphere. The integration uses AI models with prompts that are preconfigured to use input parameters to generate AI content recommendations. For example, you might want to show all objects that have been created by a specific user in the past three months.
