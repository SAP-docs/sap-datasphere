# Purchase Resources for Elastic Compute Nodes

You can purchase a number of compute blocks to allocate to elastic compute nodes.

Depending on the resources allocated to your tenant in the *Tenant Configuration* page, the administrator decides how many compute blocks they will allocate to elastic compute nodes. See [Configure the Size of Your SAP Datasphere Tenant](configure-the-size-of-your-sap-datasphere-tenant-33f8ef4.md).
