# Monitor Object Changes with Activities

Monitor the changes that users perform on modeling objects \(such as spaces and tables\) as well as changes to the system configuration \(such as roles and users\).

Actions that are performed by users are logged in *Security* \> *Activities*.

For example:

-   Space creation and changes

-   Table changes

-   Role changes and assignments

-   Logged users


On the *Activities* page, you can:

-   View the activities and filter on specific activities.

-   Download the activity log for a specific time period.

-   Delete the activity log for a specific time period.

    > ### Note:  
    > To delete the activity log, you must be granted the privilege *Activity Log* with the permission *Delete*, which is included in the system owner role and which you can include in a custom role.
