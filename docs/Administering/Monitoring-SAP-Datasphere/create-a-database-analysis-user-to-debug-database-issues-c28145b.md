# Create a Database Analysis User to Debug Database Issues

A database analysis user is an SAP HANA Cloud database user with wide-ranging privileges. It can be used to support monitoring, analyzing, tracing, and debugging of your SAP Datasphere run-time database.



## Context

A user with the *DW Administrator* role can create a database analysis user.

> ### Note:  
> You should only create a database analysis user to resolve a specific database issue and then delete it immediately after the issue is resolved. This user can access all SAP HANA Cloud monitoring views and all SAP Datasphere data in all spaces, including any sensitive data stored there.

        A database analysis user can run a procedure in Database Explorer to stop running statements. For more information, see [Stop a Running Statement](stop-a-running-statement-0cf11ed.md).


    > ### Note:  
    > All actions of the database analysis user are logged in the `ANALYSIS_AUDIT_LOG` view, which is stored in the space that has been assigned to store audit logs \(see [Enable Audit Logging](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/266553976e1c4db9aaa28a75e2308b77.html "You can enable audit logs for your space so that read and change actions (policies) are recorded. Administrators can then analyze who performed which action at which point in time.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
