# Updating User Email Addresses

You can update the user email addresses used for logon.

When you create a user, you must add an email address. The email address is used to send logon information.

To edit a user's email address, go to the *Users* page of the *Security* area, and select the email address you want to modify. Add a new email address and press *Enter*, or select another cell to set the new address.

If the email address is already assigned to another user, a warning will appear and you must enter a new address. Every user must be assigned a unique email address.

A new logon email will be sent to the updated address.

As long as a user has not logged on to the system with the new email address, the email address will appear in a pending state on the *Users* list.
