## Assign an Individual User to a Role

You can assign an individual user to a role \(global or scoped\) in the *Users* page.

1.  In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Security*\) ** \> ** <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Users*\).
2.  On the *Users* page, find the required user.
3.  In the user's row, select the <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> icon in the *Roles* column. A list of *Available Roles* will appear.

    The icon is not available if the user has the system owner role, which means that, from the *Security* \> *Users* page, you cannot assign an additional role to a user who has the system owner role. You can do so from the *Security* \> *Roles* page \(see [Create a Scoped Role to Assign Privileges to Users in Spaces](create-a-scoped-role-to-assign-privileges-to-users-in-spaces-b5c4e0b.md)\).

4.  Select one or more roles.
5.  Select *OK*.

> ### Note:  
> If you assign a user to a scoped role, be aware that the user is automatically assigned to all the spaces included in the scoped role. You can change the user assignment in the scoped role. See [Create a Scoped Role to Assign Privileges to Users in Spaces](create-a-scoped-role-to-assign-privileges-to-users-in-spaces-b5c4e0b.md).

## Assign Several Users to a Global Role

You can assign several users to a global role at the same time in the *Roles* page.

> This is not relevant for scoped roles. For information about how to assign users to spaces in a scoped role, see [Create a Scoped Role to Assign Privileges to Users in Spaces](create-a-scoped-role-to-assign-privileges-to-users-in-spaces-b5c4e0b.md).

1.  In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Security*\) ** \> ** <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Roles*\).
2.  Find the role that you want to assign.
3.  At the bottom of the role box, click the link *Add Users*.
