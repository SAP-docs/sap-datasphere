<a name="loio0889208e35e44c03821850088fae4f65__context_ppv_bms_gdc"/>

## Context

When you create a user, you must add an email address. The email address is used to send logon information.



<a name="loio0889208e35e44c03821850088fae4f65__steps_xfd_bms_gdc"/>

## Procedure

1.  In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Security*\) ** \> ** <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Users*\).

2.  Select the email address you want to modify, add a new email address and press *Enter* or select another cell.

    If the email address is already assigned to another user, a warning will appear and you must enter a new address as every user must be assigned a unique email address.

    A new logon email will be sent to the updated address. As long as a user has not logged on to the system with the new email address, the email address will appear in a pending state in the *Users* list.

3.  If the user has not received the logon email, you can resend the email. To do so, select the checkbox correponding to the user, click the enveloppe icon and click *Resend* in the dialog box that opens.
