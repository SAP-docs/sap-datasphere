# Create Spaces via the Command Line

You can use the SAP Datasphere command line interface, `datasphere`, to create, read, update, and delete spaces. You can set space properties, assign \(or remove\) users, create database users, create or update objects \(tables, views, and data access controls\), and associate HDI containers to a space.

> ### Note:  
> Relevant only for spaces with a storage type *SAP HANA Database \(Disk and In-Memory\)*, and not for *SAP HANA Data Lake Files* spaces.

To use `datasphere` to create spaces, you must have an SAP Datasphere user with the *DW Administrator* role or equivalent permissions \(see [Roles and Privileges by App and Feature](../Managing-Users-and-Roles/roles-and-privileges-by-app-and-feature-2d8b7d0.md)\).
