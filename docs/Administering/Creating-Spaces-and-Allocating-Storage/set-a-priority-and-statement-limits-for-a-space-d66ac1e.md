# Set a Priority and Statement Limits for a Space

Use the properties in the *Workload Management* section to prioritize between spaces for resource consumption and set limits to the amount of memory and threads that a space can consume when processing statements.



<a name="loiod66ac1efb5054068a104c4559b72d272__steps_abz_fhb_wrb"/>

## Procedure

1.  In the side navigation area, click ![](../images/Space_Management_a868247.png) \(*Space Management*\), locate your space tile, and click *Edit* to open it. Then, select *Workload Management*.

2.  To prioritize between spaces, enter in the *Space Priority* section the prioritization of this space when querying the database. You can enter a value from 1 \(lowest priority\) to 8 \(highest priority\). The default value is 5. In situations where spaces are competing for available threads, those with higher priorities have their statements run before those of spaces with lower priorities.

3.  To manage other workload parameters, you can select either of the following in the *Space Configuration* dropdown list:

    -   *Default*. The default configuration provides generous resource limits, while preventing any single space from overloading the system. The default configuration is applied by default to new spaces.

        These statement limit and admission control parameters are taken into account in the default configuration and cannot be changed:

    -   *Custom*. These statement limit and admission control parameters are taken into account in the custom configuration. You can specify only the value for statements limits to set maximum total thread and memory limits that statements running concurrently in the space can consume:

        In the *Total Statement Thread Limit* area, enter the maximum number \(or percentage\) of threads that statements running concurrently in the space can consume. You can enter a percentage between 1% and 100% \(or the equivalent number\) of the total number of threads available in your tenant.

        > ### Note:  
        > 100% represents the maximum of 80% of CPU resources reserved for workload generated by spaces, user group users and agent users. The remaining 20% of CPU resources are reserved to ensure that the system can respond under heavy load.

        Setting this limit prevents the space from consuming too many threads, and can help with balancing resource consumption between competing spaces.

        > ### Caution:  
        > Be aware that setting this limit too low may impact statement performance, while excessively high values may impact the performance of statements in other spaces.

        Setting this limit prevents the space from consuming all available memory, and can help with balancing resource consumption between competing spaces.

        > ### Note:  
        > If too many statements are rejected, we recommend you to do these two actions:
        > 
        > -   **Decrease the total statement thread limit for the spaces which consume a large amount of CPU time**.
        > 
        >     First, identify the spaces which consume a large amount of CPU time: As a database analysis user, analyze the M\_WORKLOAD\_CLASS\_STATISTICS view in the Database Explorer, like in this example:
        > 
        >     ```
        >     SELECT "MD"."SPACE_ID", "WCS"."TOTAL_STATEMENT_CPU_TIME", "WCS"."TOTAL_STATEMENT_REJECT_COUNT"
        >     FROM "SYS"."M_WORKLOAD_CLASS_STATISTICS" AS "WCS"
        >     LEFT JOIN "DWC_TENANT_OWNER"."SPACE_METADATA" AS "MD" ON "WCS"."WORKLOAD_CLASS_NAME" = "MD"."VALUE"
        >     AND "MD"."SECTION" = '_workloadManagement' AND "MD"."KEY" = 'workloadClassName' 
        >     WHERE "MD"."SPACE_ID" IS NOT NULL AND "MD"."SPACE_ID" != '$$global$$' ORDER BY "WCS"."TOTAL_STATEMENT_CPU_TIME" DESC
        >     
        >     ```
        > 
        >     Using this sample code, all the spaces can be listed by the TOTAL\_STATEMENT\_CPU\_TIME descending order, which enables you to identify the spaces that consumed the most CPU time.
        > 
        >     As a second step, go to the *Workload Configuration* area of each identified space, select the configuration *Custom* and decrease the total statement thread limit. Some statements will take longer to run but will not be rejected.
        > 
        > -   **Avoid that tasks which consume a high load of CPU run at the same time**.
        > 
        >     You can adjust the task schedules in the *Data Integration Monitor*.
