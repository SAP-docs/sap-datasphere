# Creating Spaces and Allocating Storage

All data acquisition, preparation, and modeling in SAP Datasphere happens inside spaces. A space is a secure area - space data cannot be accessed outside the space unless it is shared to another space or exposed for consumption.

An administrator must create one or more spaces. They allocate disk and memory storage to the space, set its priority, and can limit how much memory and how many threads its statements can consume.

If the administrator assigns one or more space administrators via a scoped role, they can then manage users, create connections to source systems, secure data with data access controls, and manage other aspects of the space \(see [Managing Your Space](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/268ea7e3e8d448deaab420219477064d.html "All data acquisition, preparation, and modeling in SAP Datasphere happens inside spaces.
