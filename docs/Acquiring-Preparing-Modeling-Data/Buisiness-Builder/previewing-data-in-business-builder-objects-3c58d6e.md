# Previewing Data in Business Builder Objects

You can check the data in your models in the data preview.

> ### Note:  
> Users with the standard *DW Modeler* role can preview data in any object in their space. Users with the *DW Viewer* role can only preview data for fact models and consumption models. For more information, see [Roles and Privileges by App and Feature](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f804b8efa8043539289f42f372c4862/cloud/en-US/2d8b7d04dcae402f911d119437ce0a74.html "Review the standard roles and the privileges needed to access apps, tools, and other features of SAP Datasphere.") :arrow_upper_right:.

The data preview is an analytic preview. It is accessible from every model in the Business Builder, but only when you access it for a consumption model, you can save it as a perspective. The functions available are mainly the same as in the perspective.

A data preview is only possible if the underlying object in the Data Builder has been deployed.

When you open the data preview from a business entity or a fact model \(only for single fact models\), you can save the data preview as a consumption model. A consumption model and a perspective is generated with the attributes and measures chosen in the data preview. This can be used as a visual method of modeling.
