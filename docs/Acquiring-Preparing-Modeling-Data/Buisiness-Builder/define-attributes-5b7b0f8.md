# Define Attributes

You can define attrbutes for your consumption model.



## Context

Attributes in consumption models can either reference attributes from the included fact or dimension sources or be calculated from other attributes of the current consumption model.

## Procedure

1.  Go to the *Attributes* tab.

2.  To define an attribute: Choose <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> *New attribute*.

    To add multiple attributes: Choose <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> *Add Attributes*. Select your attributes and choose *Apply*. To change details for an attribute, choose <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> *Details*.

3.  Select the attribute type. More information: [Attribute Types](attribute-types-911ec0d.md)

4.  Decide whether your attribute should be an *Auxiliary Attribute* meaning an attribute which can be used further within the consumption model, but is not exposed to other consumption models or the perspective.

    > ### Note:  
    > In stories in SAP Analytics Cloud, auxiliary attributes are nevertheless displayed with the prefix \[Hidden\]. The same applies to attributes, which are used indirectly, for example in restrictions.

5.  Save your entries.
