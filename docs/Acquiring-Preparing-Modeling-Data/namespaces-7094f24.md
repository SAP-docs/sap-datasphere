# Namespaces

Content managed by SAP and partners and delivered through SAP Business Data Cloud is protected by namespaces. Any object whose technical name is preceded by a namespace and a dot \(for example, `sap.s4h.Entity`\) cannot be edited.

You cannot:

-   Edit or delete any object in a namespace.
-   Create an object in a namespace.
-   Create your own namespaces.
-   Use a dot in any technical name.

For information about copying a space and its contents to create unprotected copies of namespace-protected content, see [Copy a Space and its Contents](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f804b8efa8043539289f42f372c4862/cloud/en-US/73068ac8e1934615b419d8c6c4095a9a.html "You can copy a space and all the Data Builder objects it contains into a new space.") :arrow_upper_right:.
