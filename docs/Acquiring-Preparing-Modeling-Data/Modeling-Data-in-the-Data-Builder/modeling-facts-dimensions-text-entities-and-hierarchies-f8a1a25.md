# Modeling Facts, Dimensions, Text Entities, and Hierarchies

You can enrich your entities with semantic information to make your data ready for analysis.

SAP Datasphere helps you to:

-   Specify the semantic usage of each of your entities. See:
    -   [Create a Fact to Contain Measurable Data](create-a-fact-to-contain-measurable-data-30089bd.md)
    -   [Create a Dimension to Categorize Data](create-a-dimension-to-categorize-data-5aae0e9.md)
    -   [Create a Text Entity for Attribute Translation](create-a-text-entity-for-attribute-translation-b25726d.md)
    -   [Create an External Hierarchy for Drill-Down](create-an-external-hierarchy-for-drill-down-dbac7a8.md)
    -   [Create a Hierarchy with Directory](create-a-hierarchy-with-directory-36c39ee.md)

-   Identify measures and attributes, and assign semantic types to them. See:
    -   [Specify Measures to Analyze](specify-measures-to-analyze-33f7f29.md)
    -   [Specify Attributes as Keys, Units, and Other Characteristics](specify-attributes-as-keys-units-and-other-characteristics-cedc59c.md)
    -   [Specify Semantic Types for Measures and Attributes](specify-semantic-types-for-measures-and-attributes-f7272c0.md)

-   Set key columns and create associations between entities. See:
    -   [Set Key Columns to Uniquely Identify Records](set-key-columns-to-uniquely-identify-records-d9ef2c9.md)
    -   [Create an Association to Define a Semantic Relationship Between Entities](create-an-association-to-define-a-semantic-relationship-between-entities-66c6998.md)


Your entities can be exposed for consumption:

-   Directly as relational objects via OData or ODBC \(views only\). See [Exposing a View For Consumption](exposing-a-view-for-consumption-40ec77e.md).
-   Combined and further refined and enriched via an analytic model. See [Creating an Analytic Model](creating-an-analytic-model-e5fbe9e.md).
-   Via further combination in the *Business Builder*. See [Modeling Data in the Business Builder](../Buisiness-Builder/modeling-data-in-the-business-builder-3829d46.md).
