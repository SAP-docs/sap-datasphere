## Model Facts, Dimensions, Texts, and Hierarchies

![](images/Star_Schema_9239037.png)

Use the *Semantic Usage* property to indicate the type of data contained in your entity:

-   Select a *Semantic Usage* of *Fact* to indicate that your entity contains numerical measures that can be analyzed.

    In our example, `Acme Sales View` is a fact containing sales data.

-   Select a *Semantic Usage* of *Dimension* to indicate that your entity contains attributes that can be used to analyze and categorize measures defined in other entities.

    In our example, four dimensions surround the fact, allowing us to analyze it by `Salespeople`, `Time`, `Product`, and `Geo` attributes.

-   Select a *Semantic Usage* of *Text* to indicate that your entity contains strings with language identifiers to translate text attributes in other entities.

    In our example, there are four translation entities to translate time and product dimension attributes.

-   Select a *Semantic Usage* of *Hierarchy* to indicate that your entity contains parent-child relationships for members in a dimension.

    In our example, the `Acme Salespeople Hierarchy` provides a hierarchy for the `Salespeople` dimension.




<a name="loio5c1e3d4a49554fcd8fcf199d664d1109__section_facts"/>

## Identify Measures to Analyze in a Fact

Facts are entities that contain numerical measures that can be analyzed and are the principal type of object that is consumed by BI clients \(see [Create a Fact to Contain Measurable Data](create-a-fact-to-contain-measurable-data-30089bd.md)\).

-   To get started: Select a *Semantic Usage* of *Fact* to indicate that your entity contains numerical measures that can be analyzed.
-   You must identify at least one measure \(see [Specify Measures to Analyze](specify-measures-to-analyze-33f7f29.md)\).
-   You can create associations to dimensions and text entities \(see [Create an Association to Define a Semantic Relationship Between Entities](create-an-association-to-define-a-semantic-relationship-between-entities-66c6998.md)\).
-   To expose your data for consumption in SAP Analytics Cloud, add it to an analytic model \(see [Creating an Analytic Model](creating-an-analytic-model-e5fbe9e.md)\).



<a name="loio5c1e3d4a49554fcd8fcf199d664d1109__section_dimensions"/>

## Prepare Master Data for Grouping in a Dimension

Dimensions are entities that contain master data that categorize and group the numerical data contained in your measures \(see [Create a Dimension to Categorize Data](create-a-dimension-to-categorize-data-5aae0e9.md)\).

-   To get started: Select a *Semantic Usage* of *Dimension* to indicate that your entity contains attributes that can be used to analyze and categorize measures defined in other entities.

-   You must set at least one key column \(see [Set Key Columns to Uniquely Identify Records](set-key-columns-to-uniquely-identify-records-d9ef2c9.md)\).
-   You can create associations to other dimensions, text entities, and hierarchies \(see [Create an Association to Define a Semantic Relationship Between Entities](create-an-association-to-define-a-semantic-relationship-between-entities-66c6998.md)\).
-   You can add parent-child or level-based hierarchies to support drill-down \(see [Add a Hierarchy to a Dimension](add-a-hierarchy-to-a-dimension-218b7e6.md)\).
-   You can make your dimension time-dependent, so that its members can change over time \(see [Enable Time-Dependency for a Dimension or Text Entity](enable-time-dependency-for-a-dimension-or-text-entity-11b2ff4.md)\).



<a name="loio5c1e3d4a49554fcd8fcf199d664d1109__section_texts"/>

## Support Translations of Attributes with a Text Entity

Text entities are entities that contain data to store strings in multiple languages for translating attributes in other entities \(see [Create a Text Entity for Attribute Translation](create-a-text-entity-for-attribute-translation-b25726d.md)\).

-   To get started: Select a *Semantic Usage* of *Text* to indicate that your entity contains strings with language identifiers to translate text attributes in other entities.

-   You must specify attributes and keys to uniquely identify a master data member and a language.
-   You can make your text entity time-dependent, so that the texts it contains can change over time \(see [Enable Time-Dependency for a Dimension or Text Entity](enable-time-dependency-for-a-dimension-or-text-entity-11b2ff4.md)\).



<a name="loio5c1e3d4a49554fcd8fcf199d664d1109__section_hierarchies"/>

## Enable Drill-Down with a Hierarchy

External hierarchies are entities that contain data to define parent-child relationships for a dimension \(see [Create an External Hierarchy for Drill-Down](create-an-external-hierarchy-for-drill-down-dbac7a8.md)\).

-   To get started: Select a *Semantic Usage* of *Hierarchy* to indicate that your entity contains parent-child relationships for members in a dimension.
-   You must specify the parent and child attributes and set the child attribute as a key.

> ### Note:  
> Parent-child and level-based hierarchies can also be defined directly in a dimension. See [Add a Hierarchy to a Dimension](add-a-hierarchy-to-a-dimension-218b7e6.md).



<a name="loio5c1e3d4a49554fcd8fcf199d664d1109__section_hierarchy_with_directory"/>

## Create Heterogeneous Hierarchies with a Hierarchy with Directory

A hierarchy with directory is an entity that contains one or more parent-child hierarchies and has an association to a directory dimension containing a list of the hierarchies. These types of hierarchy entities can include nodes from multiple dimensions \(for example, country, cost center group, and cost center\) and are commonly imported from SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP BW systems \(see [Create a Hierarchy with Directory](create-a-hierarchy-with-directory-36c39ee.md)\).



<a name="loio5c1e3d4a49554fcd8fcf199d664d1109__section_analytic_model"/>

## Combine Entities for Consumption in an Analytic Model

Once your fact is ready for use, create an analytic model from it to consume its data in SAP Analytics Cloud \(see [Creating an Analytic Model](creating-an-analytic-model-e5fbe9e.md)\).

-   To get started: In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Data Builder*\), select a space if necessary, and click *New Analytic Model* to open the editor.
-   You must add a fact as a source and can choose to copy all its measures, attributes and associated dimensions to the analytic model \(see [Add a Fact to an Analytic Model](add-a-fact-to-an-analytic-model-27075ee.md)\).
-   You can deselect measures and attributes to leave only those that are relevant to answer your particular analytic question.
-   You can create additional calculated and restricted measures \(see [Create a Measure in an Analytic Model](create-a-measure-in-an-analytic-model-e4cc3e8.md)\).
-   You can create multiple tightly-focused analytic models from a single fact, each providing only the data needed for a particular BI context, and enriched with appropriate variables, filters, and additional measures as necessary.

</table>

\* The workflow of consuming views with a semantic usage of *Analytical Dataset* in SAP Analytics Cloud and Microsoft Excel via live connection is now deprecated. We recommend that you migrate your analytical datasets to the new *Fact* semantic usage and expose your view data via analytic models \(see [Analytical Datasets \(Deprecated\)](analytical-datasets-deprecated-70dab71.md)\).

\*\* SAP Analytics Cloud primarily uses the consumption of view data via OData for planning \(see [Integrate with SAP Analytics Cloud for Planning](https://help.sap.com/viewer/43509d67b8b84e66a30851e832f66911/cloud/en-US/f589cdea41674badaecfa1bf02571b6f.html "SAP Datasphere integrates with SAP Analytics Cloud to act as a data source for loading actuals or external data into a planning model, and can also persist your planning data and combine it with live actuals or other data as appropriate.") :arrow_upper_right:\).

> ### Note:  
> Before exposing data for consumption, you should consider applying row-level security via data access controls \(see [Securing Data with Data Access Controls](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/a032e51c730147c7a1fcac125b4cfe14.html "Users with a space administrator role can create data access controls to allow modelers to apply row-level security to Data Builder and Business Builder objects.

## Create Objects and Act On Existing Objects

All the objects you import or create in the *Data Builder* are listed on the *Data Builder* start page. You can act on objects in the list in the following ways:

-   Click one of the tabs to filter the list by object type.
-   Click a tile to create a new object
-   Click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Show filters\) to filter the list on collections and search by criteria. Click *Show More* to open a dialog with additional filter options.
-   Enter one or more characters in the *Search* field and press *Enter* \(or click *Search*\). 
    -   If you've searched for objects before, clicking in the search field shows a list of recently entered searches. As you type, the field will begin proposing objects and search strings. Select an object to open it directly. Click on a string to start a search on it. 

    -   The search is case-insensitive and automatically applies wildcards so that, for example, the string "`lend`" will find objects containing both "`lender`" and "`calendar`".

    -   If natural language search is enabled on your tenant \(and you have the appropriate role\), the search field will propose example natural language strings that are appropriate to your current filter context. Select an example string or enter your own and SAP Datasphere will interpret it and filter your results appropriately. See [Natural Language Search](../Creating-Finding-Sharing-Objects/natural-language-search-04170c6.md).


-   Click a column header to sort or filter the list by values in the column.
-   Select one or more objects and use any of the following tools:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">
