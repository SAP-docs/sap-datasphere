# Add a Dimension to an Analytic Model

You can add dimensions to your analytic model.



## Context

For more information about dimensions, see [Dimensions in the Analytic Model](dimensions-in-the-analytic-model-b05ddf4.md).



## Procedure

There are different ways to add dimensions:

1.  When you select your source, you can select the dimensions that you want to copy from the source.

2.  When you click on your fact source on the canvas, you can select associated dimensions and attributes in the properties panel on the right. The attributes are also treated as dimensions in the analytic model.

3.  When you click on a dimension on the canvas, you can select associated dimensions of the dimension in the properties panel on the right.

4.  To edit the properties of a dimension: Click on the dimension of the canvas to show its properties in the side panel. You can make the following changes here:

    -   You can change the business name of the dimension, the technical name, and the technical name of the attribute.
    -   You can add or deselect associated dimensions.
    -   You can add or deselect attributes.
    -   You can specify a custom prefix or suffix for the technical name of attributes. For more information, see [Add a Prefix or a Suffix to Dimension Attributes](add-a-prefix-or-a-suffix-to-dimension-attributes-0373c60.md).
    -   You can change the technical name of the attributes. This is helpful when you have duplicated attributes in your analytic model, and you want to differentiate between them.
