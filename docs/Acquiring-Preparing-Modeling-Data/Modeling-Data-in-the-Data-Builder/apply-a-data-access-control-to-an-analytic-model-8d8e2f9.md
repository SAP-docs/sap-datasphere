# Apply a Data Access Control to an Analytic Model

You can apply one or more data access controls to an analytic model to control the data that users will see based on the specified criteria.



## Context

For detailed information about defining and using data access controls, see [Securing Data with Data Access Controls](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/a032e51c730147c7a1fcac125b4cfe14.html "Users with a space administrator role can create data access controls to allow modelers to apply row-level security to Data Builder and Business Builder objects. Once a data access control is applied to an object, any user viewing its data either directly or via an object using it as a source, will see only those records they are authorized to view, based on the specified criteria.") :arrow_upper_right:.
