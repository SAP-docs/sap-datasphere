# Replace the Fact Source of an Analytic Model

You can replace the fact source of an existing analytic model.



## Context

You can replace the fact source without loosing everything that you already modeled. Make sure to select a suitable replacement fact source. Suitable means that the new entity uses the same technical names for attributes, measures, associations, and input parameters.



## Procedure

1.  You are in the editor of your analytic model. Drag the new fact source onto the fact source of the analytic model on the canvas. A confirmation pop-up with a summary what is changed will be shown.

2.  A validation runs and shows error message if references are broken, for example attributes missing, measures missing, associations missing, parameters missing, or a new parameter which is not populated.

3.  Based on the validations you can make the necessary adjustments.
