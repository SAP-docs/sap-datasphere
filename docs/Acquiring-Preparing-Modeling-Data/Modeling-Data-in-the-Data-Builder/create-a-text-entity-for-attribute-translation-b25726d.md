# Create a Text Entity for Attribute Translation

Select a *Semantic Usage* of *Text* to indicate that your entity contains strings with language identifiers to translate text attributes in other entities.



## Context

For example:

-   The `Time Dimension - Day` dimension generated by SAP Datasphere contains a `Month` column that stores as numbers \(with `01` representing January, `02` February, `03` for March, and so on\).
-   The text entity `Translation Table - Month` contains the names of these months in English, French, German, and Spanish and can provide the name in the appropriate language.
-   A text association is drawn from the `Month` column to the *Identifier* column in the `Translation Table - Month` text entity.

> ### Note:  
> When a dimension has a compound key defined, you can only provide translations for the representative key column. Other key columns in the compound key cannot be translated. See [Compound Keys and Representative Keys](set-key-columns-to-uniquely-identify-records-d9ef2c9.md#loiod9ef2c91f6d647e584bad51999e441cd__section_compound_keys).



## Procedure

1.  In the table editor or view editor output node side panel, complete the *General* section as follows:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Property
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Description
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Business Name
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Enter a descriptive name to help users identify the object. This name can be changed at any time. 
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Technical Name
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Displays the name used in scripts and code, synchronized by default with the *Business Name*.

    To override the default technical name, enter a new one in the field. Technical names can contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

    > ### Note:  
    > Once the object is saved, the technical name can no longer be modified.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Package
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Select the package to which the object belongs. 

    Packages are used to group related objects in order to facilitate their transport between tenants.

    > ### Note:  
    > Once a package is selected, it cannot be changed here. Only a user with the DW Space Administrator role \(or equivalent privileges\) can modify a package assignment in the *Packages* editor.

Modelers can add objects to packages via the Package field, which appears in editors when a package is created in their space.

The structure of your package is preserved and, as the objects it contains evolve, you can easily export updated versions of it.") :arrow_upper_right:.

2.  Specify your attributes \(see [Specify Attributes as Keys, Units, and Other Characteristics](specify-attributes-as-keys-units-and-other-characteristics-cedc59c.md)\).

    You must specify at least the following attributes:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Content
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Key
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Semantic Type
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Text / Association
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Identifiers

    One or more identifiers specify the dimension member for which the text is provided.

    If more than one identifier is specified, ensure that the representative key is specified in the dimension.

    Example: `01`
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Yes
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    None
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Select the attribute with the *Text* semantic type for the identifier or representative key.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Language Identifier

    Specifies the language in which the text is provided and must be used with the appropriate <code>String(<i class="varname">&lt;n&gt;</i>)</code> data type.

    Example: `fr`

    > ### Note:  
    > The following identifier formats are supported:
    > 
    > -   `F` - `String(1)`
    > -   `fr` - `String(2)`
    > -   `FR` - `String(2)`
    > -   `fr-FR` - `String(5)`
    > 
    > For the list of data access languages supported by SAP Analytics Cloud, see [Supported Data Access Languages](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/8310076258a94a4194a926506b80c390.html).

    <td valign="top">
    
    *Language*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    \-
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Validity Start Date

    \[optional\] For time-dependent text entities, specifies the date from which the text is valid \(see [Enable Time-Dependency for a Dimension or Text Entity](enable-time-dependency-for-a-dimension-or-text-entity-11b2ff4.md)\).

    Example: `01/01/2022`
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Yes
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Business Date - From*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    \-
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Validity End Date

    \[optional\] For time-dependent text entities, specifies the date until which the text is valid.

    Example: `31/12/2022`
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    No
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Business Date - To*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    \-
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Text

    Provides the text in the appropriate language.

    Example: `January`
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    No
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Text*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    \-
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
3.  Set attributes as keys to indicate that the data they contain can uniquely identify records.

    > ### Note:  
    > You must set two or more key attributes for a *Text Entity*:
    > 
    > -   One or more identifiers
    > -   Language Identifier
    > -   Validity Start Date - if time-dependency is required \(see [Enable Time-Dependency for a Dimension or Text Entity](enable-time-dependency-for-a-dimension-or-text-entity-11b2ff4.md)\)

    To set an attribute as a key column, select the checkbox in the *Key* column or hover over the attribute in the side panel and click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Menu\)** \> *Set as Key*.

4.  Click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Save\)** \> *Save* to save your entity or click <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(Deploy\) to save and deploy it immediately.
