# Create a Structure for an Analytic Model

In order to create restrictions and calculations across all measures of an analytic model, you can create structures.



## Context

Structures help you to save time and ensure consistency in your calculations, as you donâ€™t need to create a formula/calculation for each measure. In the data preview, the structure members are displayed in their own section. When you use a structure member in the drill-down of a preview, the restriction and calculations defined in the structure member will be applied to each measure. Structures can also be used and enhanced in SAP Analytics Cloud. See

You can create one structure with multiple members for one analytic model.

In case the analytic model has measures and a structure, and both contain calculations or formulas, you can define how the calculations should be prioritized.

> ### Example:  
> You can restrict the country to Germany for all measures in the analytic model with a restricted structure member. If you want to easily apply the same restriction \(like attribute *Country* = Germany\) to all measures \(like value, volume, price, tax amount etc.\) in a table, you can proceed as follows:
> 
> 1.  Create a structure.
> 2.  Add a restricted member with the restriction expression `Country = Germany`.
> 3.  Open the preview.
> 4.  Select all measures for display, and use the structure members in the drill-down.
