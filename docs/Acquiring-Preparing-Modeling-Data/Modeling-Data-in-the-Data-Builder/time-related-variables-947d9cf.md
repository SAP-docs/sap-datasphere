# Time-Related Variables

Sub types are used to create time-related variables.

For standard variables, you can choose a sub type:

Reference date variable: When the analytic model has associations to a time-dependent dimension or text table, you can define a reference date variable. See [Create a Reference Date Variable](create-a-reference-date-variable-a2d060e.md).

Fiscal variant: When you add a fiscal time dimension to an analytic model, a standard variable of sub type *Fiscal Variant* is created for this dimension. See [Add a Fiscal Time Dimension](add-a-fiscal-time-dimension-6d1ff74.md).
