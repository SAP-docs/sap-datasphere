# Preview Data in an Analytic Model

The data preview helps you to determine wether your data is correct.

As this is an analytical preview, you can navigate through the various dimensions, and view the aggregated data. This means, you can see how the data will look like in an SAP Analytics Cloud story.

You can drill down by rows and columns by clicking on the icons at the objects.
