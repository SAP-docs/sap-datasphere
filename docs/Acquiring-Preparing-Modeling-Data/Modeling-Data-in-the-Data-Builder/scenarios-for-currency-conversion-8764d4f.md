# Scenarios for Currency Conversion

There are several scenarios conceivable for currency conversion.





### Translation into group- or local currency:

-   You store all values in the document currency in an analytic model. You want to translate all values into the group currency.

-   You will get values in various currencies from your source system. You want to store all values in the document currency and in your group currency \(EUR for example\) in the analytic model.

-   You store all the values in one currency in the analytic model. Subsidiaries want to translate these values into their local currency using the exchange rate for the current day.




### Currency difference report:

-   You want to compare values with both current exchange rates and historical exchange rates. This way you can analyze the effect of exchange rates.

-   You want to compare the actual exchange rates with those valid on the posting date. This allows you to analyze the effect of changes in the exchange rates between the posting date and the current date.
