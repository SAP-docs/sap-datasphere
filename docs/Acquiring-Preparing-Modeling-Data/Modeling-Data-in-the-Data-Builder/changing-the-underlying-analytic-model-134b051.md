# Changing the underlying Analytic Model

Note the effect of changes to an analytic model which is used as a source for other analytic models.

When changes are made to an analytic model which is used as a source for other analytic models, the status of the dependent analytic model\(s\) is changed to *Changes to Deploy*or *Design Time Error*, depending on the changes.

When you save or deploy an analytic model that is reused by other analytic models after having changed the dimension source, measures, variables or attributes, you will get a warning that this can affect existing analytic models, and the status of dependent analytic models will be updated accordingly.
