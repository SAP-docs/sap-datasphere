# Exposing Data For Consumption

Data can only be accessed outside of your SAP Datasphere space if it is exposed for consumption.

Data can be exposed as analytic models, perspectives, and views, which are accessible to clients, tools, and apps as follows:

\* The workflow of consuming views with a semantic usage of *Analytical Dataset* in SAP Analytics Cloud and Microsoft Excel via live connection is now deprecated. We recommend that you migrate your analytical datasets to the new *Fact* semantic usage and expose your view data via analytic models \(see [Analytical Datasets \(Deprecated\)](analytical-datasets-deprecated-70dab71.md)\).

\*\* SAP Analytics Cloud primarily uses the consumption of view data via OData for planning \(see [Integrate with SAP Analytics Cloud for Planning](https://help.sap.com/viewer/43509d67b8b84e66a30851e832f66911/cloud/en-US/f589cdea41674badaecfa1bf02571b6f.html "SAP Datasphere integrates with SAP Analytics Cloud to act as a data source for loading actuals or external data into a planning model, and can also persist your planning data and combine it with live actuals or other data as appropriate.") :arrow_upper_right:\).

> ### Note:  
> Before exposing data for consumption, you should consider applying row-level security via data access controls \(see [Securing Data with Data Access Controls](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/a032e51c730147c7a1fcac125b4cfe14.html "Users with a space administrator role can create data access controls to allow modelers to apply row-level security to Data Builder and Business Builder objects. Once a data access control is applied to an object, any user viewing its data either directly or via an object using it as a source, will see only those records they are authorized to view, based on the specified criteria.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
