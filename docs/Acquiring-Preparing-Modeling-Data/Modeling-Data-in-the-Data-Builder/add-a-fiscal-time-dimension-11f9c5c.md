# Add a Fiscal Time Dimension

You can add a fiscal time dimension to an analytic model so that you can use fiscal period in your finance domain.

When you add a fiscal time dimension to an analytic model, a variable is created for this dimension. The variable can then be handled like any other variable. Its data type is derived from the fiscal variance column from the fiscal time dimension.

An analytic model can contain only one physical variant variable.
