# Dynamic Default

The value of a variable for the variable prompt can be derived.

When you choose *Dynamic Default* in the properties of a variable, you get a derived value in the parameter dialog list when opening the analytic preview, and in the variable prompt for an SAP Analytics Cloud story.

> ### Note:  
> *Dynamic Default* is only supported for standard variables and reference date variables.

The properties *Dynamic Default* and *Derived Value* are quite similar. They differ in when the derivation takes place:

-   for *Dynamic Default*, the value is derived before the variable prompt pops up.
-   For *Derive Value*, the derivation happens after you have chosen your values in the variable prompt.


This means that dynamic default values appear in the variable prompt when opening the analytic preview while derived values do not appear in the prompt.
