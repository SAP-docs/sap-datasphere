A free data product does not need a license and can be downloaded directly from the data marketplace.

## Prerequisites

The privileges DW Modeler and DW Integrator must be assigned as scoped roles including the respective spaces as scopes to the user.

You must have either the roles DW Integrator and DW Modeler, as the data marketplace creates artifacts and loads data. If you do not have sufficient privileges, the load button is disabled.
