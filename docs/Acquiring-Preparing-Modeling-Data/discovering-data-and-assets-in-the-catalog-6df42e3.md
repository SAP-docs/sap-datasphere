## Evaluate Data and Assets

When you find an item that interests you, view descriptions and other metadata about it. You can also view information on how to use the object and see the impact and lineage diagram that shows its source, the transformations it goes through, its final state, and other objects affected by changes made to it. All this information helps you decide if the data or asset is what you want.

See:

-   [Accessing Catalog Assets](accessing-catalog-assets-dc061a2.md)
-   [Installing Marketplace Data Products](installing-marketplace-data-products-92c35ef.md)
-   [Installing Data Products](installing-data-products-ea7cb80.md)

Marketplace data products are only available in the SAP Datasphere catalog.

## Use Data and Assets

After finding and evaluating the data or asset, you can do one of the following:

-   Open the catalog asset to view the asset in its source system.
-   Install the data product to a space on the local SAP Datasphere tenant.
-   Use the installed data product or asset as part of an existing data project to build something new.
-   Share the data product to a target system.

To use the data in an SAP app, see the help documentation for the app you want to use. For example:

-   As a data modeler in SAP Datasphere, you can use the asset as a source for a Data Builder or Business Builder object.
