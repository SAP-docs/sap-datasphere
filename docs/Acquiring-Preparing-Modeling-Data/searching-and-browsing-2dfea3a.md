# Searching and Browsing

Search or browse for products using the search function or landing page.

You find the *Search* function either on the *Landing Page* or within the Data Marketplace menu. Both options allow you to browse through the search result list by different filter criteria.

You can search and browse for data products and data providers. Either select *Data Products* or *Providers* from the dropdown list next to the search input field. After you entered the search term press [Enter\] on your keyboard or click on the icon ![](images/DM_Search_Icon_d8ecf6e.jpg).

The search results will be displayed in a list and are sorted by best match by default. You can change the sorting criteria if you like.

You can use filter criteria to limit the search results. On the left-hand side next to the search result list you find the filter criteria. Click on *Show All Filters* at the end of the filter list shown to get the complete list of all filters and options. On the popup you can also define filter conditions for each filter.

To see only free data products, select the option *Free* from the filter *Contract Type*. All data products which have a different contract type, for example License Key, are set to hidden in the search result list. The list will get smaller.

For more information on the available filters, see [Overview of Filters](overview-of-filters-e883a91.md).

By clicking an entry in the search result list, you will be directly forwarded to the corresponding data product page or data provider profile. There, you can evaluate the data product or data provider and eventually bookmark them. For more information, see [Using Bookmarks](using-bookmarks-aec68bb.md).

You can use the Datarade data finder website to search and request additional third-party data products from various data providers. Access Datarade by clicking the *Request Data from Datarade* button.
