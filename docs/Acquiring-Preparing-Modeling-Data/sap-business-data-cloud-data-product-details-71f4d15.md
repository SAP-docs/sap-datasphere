# SAP Business Data Cloud Data Product Details

If you're interested in a data product, review its detailed information, such as properties about the data product, like its name and the data provider, the list of entities within the data product, and links to resources for how to use it.



The catalog search results provides high-level information about a data product, including its name, data type, and a short summary. If you want to know more about a data product, select it to view its details page that provides many different types of information about it. This information includes properties about the data product, detailed information about the APIs, and resources that can provide information or examples on how to use the data product.

For example, when a data modeler reviews the details of a data product, they can check out any of the resources to get information about how to use it. They can also review individual APIs and learn how to extend them.

After you data product details, you can choose to install it in your space \(see [Evaluating and Installing SAP Business Data Cloud Data Products](evaluating-and-installing-sap-business-data-cloud-data-products-ea7cb80.md)\).



To get high-level information about the data product, review the header section.
