# Importing and Exporting Objects in CSN/JSON Files

You can use the tools in certain *Data Builder* editors to import objects to and export objects from your space.

The following object types can be exported and imported via CSN files:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Object Type

</th>
<th valign="top">

Details

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Local Tables

</td>
<td valign="top">

The definition of a local table contains the structure of the table only, and does not have dependencies on any other objects.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Remote Tables

</td>
<td valign="top">

The definition of a remote table contains information about its connection.

> ### Note:  
> Remote tables exported from one space can be imported into another only if they were originally imported from a connection created in v2021.19 or later.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Views

</td>
<td valign="top">

The definition of a view contains the definitions of all its sources and any used data access controls. When you export a view, these objects are exported too.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Flows

</td>
<td valign="top">

The definition of a data flow, replication flow, or transformation flow contains the definitions of all its sources and its target table. When you export a flow, these objects are exported too.

<tr>
<td valign="top">

Intelligent Lookups

</td>
<td valign="top">

The definition of an intelligent lookup contains the definitions of its input and lookup entities. When you export an intelligent lookup, these entities are exported too.
