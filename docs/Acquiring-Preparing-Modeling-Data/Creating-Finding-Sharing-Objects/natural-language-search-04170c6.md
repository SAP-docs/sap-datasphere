# Natural Language Search

If natural language search is enabled on your tenant \(and you have the appropriate role\), the search field will propose example natural language strings that are appropriate to your current filter context. Select an example string or enter your own and SAP Datasphere will interpret it and filter your results appropriately.

## Prerequisites

To use natural language search, it must be enabled in your tenant \(see [Enable SAP Business AI for SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/1b3fe45f38df4db1a9cda97a5a7bcdaf.html "SAP Business AI is a fully managed service by SAP that allows you to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) models in different business solutions. SAP Business AI provides a simple and easy-to-use API with various endpoints that you can use in your solution for different tasks such as text generation, summarization, language translation, creative content development.") :arrow_upper_right:\) and you must have both a global role and a scoped role:

-   A global role that grants you the following privilege:
    -   *Data Warehouse General* \(`-R------`\) - To access SAP Datasphere.
    -   *Data Warehouse AI Consumption* \(`----E---`\) - To use SAP Business AI features.

-   A scoped role that grants you access to the space or spaces to search in with the following privilege:
    -   *Data Warehouse General* \(`-R------`\) - To access SAP Datasphere.
    -   *Spaces Files* \(`-R------`\) - To access objects in a space.


The *DW AI Consumer* global role and the *DW Modeler* scoped role template, applied together for example, grant these privileges \(see [Standard Roles Delivered with SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/a50a51d80d5746c9b805a2aacbb7e4ee.html "SAP Datasphere is delivered with several standard roles. A standard role includes a predefined set of privileges and permissions.") :arrow_upper_right: and [Privileges and Permissions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/d7350c6823a14733a7a5727bad8371aa.html "A privilege represents a task or an area in SAP Datasphere and can be assigned to a specific role. The actions that can be performed in the area are determined by the permissions assigned to a privilege.") :arrow_upper_right:\).

## Using Natural Language Search

Entering a natural language search string allows you to quickly filter your list of objects without looking for specific filter settings.

Natural language search is available in:

-   The *Repository Explorer* - See [Repository Explorer](repository-explorer-f8ce0b4.md).
-   The *Data Builder* start page - See [Acquiring Data](../Acquiring-and-Preparing-Data-in-the-Data-Builder/acquiring-data-1f15a29.md).
-   The *Source Browser* - See [Using the Source Browser](../using-the-source-browser-7d2b21d.md).

> ### Note:  
> Natural language search is supported in English only, but may provide useable results in other languages.

You can, at any time, click the <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î…¹</span> \(Show AI-Generated Filter Conditions\) to verify how SAP Datasphere has interpreted your phrase.

> ### Note:  
> The use of natural language is not automatic and depends upon the string entered:
> 
> -   One word - Natural language search is not used.
> -   Two words - Natural language search is used if the standard search returns no results.
> -   Three or more words - Natural language search is always used.
