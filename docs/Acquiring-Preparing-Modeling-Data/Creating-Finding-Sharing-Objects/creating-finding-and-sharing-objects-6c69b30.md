# Creating, Finding, and Sharing Objects

All SAP Datasphere users use the *Repository Explorer* to browse objects. Modelers can create objects and otherwise act on them here or in the dedicated builder apps. Users with the *Catalog User* role can, additionally, browse the *Catalog* for trusted data assets that have been published there.

## Create or Import Objects

You can create objects in the *Repository Explorer* \(see [Repository Explorer](repository-explorer-f8ce0b4.md)\) or in the dedicated builders.

You can also import objects from CSN/JSON files \(see [Importing and Exporting Objects in CSN/JSON Files](importing-and-exporting-objects-in-csn-json-files-f8ff062.md)\), including via the command line \(see [Importing and Exporting Objects via the Command Line](importing-and-exporting-objects-via-the-command-line-6494657.md)\).

## Find Objects

You can search across all the objects in all the spaces you're assigned to in the *Repository Explorer* \(see [Repository Explorer](repository-explorer-f8ce0b4.md)\).

Alternatively, you can browse for trusted data assets that have been published to the *Catalog* \(see [Finding and Accessing Data in the Catalog](finding-and-accessing-data-in-the-catalog-1047825.md)\).

## Share Objects

Only users assigned to a space can view objects in the space. To make a table or view in your space available to users assigned to another space, you must share it there \(see [Sharing Tables and Views To Other Spaces](sharing-tables-and-views-to-other-spaces-64b318f.md)\).
