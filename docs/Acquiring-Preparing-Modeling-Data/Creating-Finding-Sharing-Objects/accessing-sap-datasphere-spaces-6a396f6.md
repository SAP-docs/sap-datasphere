# Accessing SAP Datasphere Spaces

All data acquisition, preparation, and modeling in SAP Datasphere happens inside spaces. A space is a secure area - space data cannot be accessed outside the space unless it is shared to another space or exposed for consumption.

You may be assigned to one or more spaces. For each space you are assigned to, you can see all the objects in that space.

Many apps, such as the *Data Builder*, require you to select a space before you can open the app. When you select a space, the app will then show you only the relevant objects that belong to that space. The *Repository Explorer*, by contrast shows you objects from all the spaces you are assigned to, in order to give you a global view of all your objects.
