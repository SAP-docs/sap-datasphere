## Prerequisites

To create folders in the *Repository Explorer*, *Data Builder*, or *Business Builder* to organize the objects in their spaces, you must have a scoped role that grants you access to a space with the following privileges:

-   *Data Warehouse General* \(`-R------`\) - To access SAP Datasphere.
-   *Data Warehouse Folder* \(`C-UD----`\) - To create, manage and delete folders.
-   *Spaces Files* \(`-R------`\) - To access objects in a space.
-   *Data Warehouse Data Builder* \(`CRUD----`\) - To create, move and delete folders in the *Data Builder*.
-   *Data Warehouse Business Builder* \(`CRUD----`\) - To create, move and delete folders in the *Business Builder*.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can create, move or delete a folder in the *Repository Explorer*, *Data Builder*, or *Business Builder* and it is immediately taken into account across each of these apps even if the scoped role does not grant access to all of these apps.


The *DW Modeler* role template, for example, grants these privileges \(see [Standard Roles Delivered with SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/a50a51d80d5746c9b805a2aacbb7e4ee.html "SAP Datasphere is delivered with several standard roles. A standard role includes a predefined set of privileges and permissions.") :arrow_upper_right: and [Privileges and Permissions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/d7350c6823a14733a7a5727bad8371aa.html "A privilege represents a task or an area in SAP Datasphere and can be assigned to a specific role.

## Introduction to Folders

Folders help to organize objects in your space. You can create a folder in the *Repository Explorer*, *Data Builder*, or *Business Builder* and it is immediately available across each of these apps.

Once a folder is created, you can move objects to it or create objects in it. You can create as many levels of folder as necessary.

> ### Note:  
> Each object in a space must have a unique technical name. You may not create two views with the name *Sales\_US* in the *Sales* space, even if they are saved in different folders.
