## Context

For detailed information about defining and using data access controls, see [Securing Data with Data Access Controls](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/a032e51c730147c7a1fcac125b4cfe14.html "Data access controls allow you to apply row-level security to your objects. When a data access control is applied to a data layer view or a business layer object, any user viewing its data will see only the rows for which they are authorized, based on the specified criteria.") :arrow_upper_right:.



## Procedure

1.  In the left navigation area, click *Data Builder* and select the space you want to work in.

2.  Open the view that you want to apply the data access control to.

3.  Select the output node of the view and open the *Data Access Control* section in its side panel and click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Add\).

    Find available objects by entering the object's name in the search bar or click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Show filters\) and filter by *Semantic Usage* or other criteria.  

4.  In the *Join* section, map columns from your view to the criteria columns defined in the data access control.

    You must map a column from your view to each of the criteria columns defined in the data access control in order to correctly filter your view's data by the criteria.

5.  Click <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(Deploy\) to save and deploy the view.




## Results

Users opening your view in SAP Datasphere or in SAP Analytics Cloud or other analytics tools will only see the data permitted by the assignment of their username to the criteria defined in the data access control.
