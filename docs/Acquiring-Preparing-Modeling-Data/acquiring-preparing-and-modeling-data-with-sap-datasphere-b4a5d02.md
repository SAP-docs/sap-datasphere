-   Creating, Finding, and Sharing Objects - All SAP Datasphere users can use the *Repository Explorer* to browse objects. Users with a modeler role can create objects and otherwise act on them here or in the dedicated builder apps. Users with a catalog user role can, additionally, browse the *Catalog* for trusted data assets that have been published there. For more information, see [Creating, Finding, and Sharing Objects](Creating-Finding-Sharing-Objects/creating-finding-and-sharing-objects-6c69b30.md).
-   Purchasing External Data - Users with the *DW Modeler* role can purchase external data from the *Data Marketplace* to combine with and enrich their internal data. For more information, see  <?sap-ot O2O class="- topic/xref " href="4096fb8c97dd4d84a7200941c1721368.xml" text="" desc="" xtrc="xref:2" xtrf="file:/home/builder/src/dita-all/mfv1753212261668/loioc25299a38b6448f889a43b42c9e5897d_en-US/src/content/localization/en-us/b4a5d02cefdf45478e7376860c985202.xml" output-class="" outputTopicFile="file:/home/builder/tp.net.sf.dita-ot/2.3/plugins/com.elovirta.dita.markdown_1.3.0/xsl/dita2markdownImpl.xsl" ?> .
-   Acquiring and Preparing Data - Users with a modeler role can import data directly into the *Data Builder* from connections and other sources, and use flows to replicate, extract, transform and load data. For more information, see [Acquiring Data](Acquiring-and-Preparing-Data-in-the-Data-Builder/acquiring-data-1f15a29.md).
-   Modeling Data in the Data Builder - Users with a modeler role can add semantic information to their entities and combine, refine, and enrich them in tightly-focused analytic models for consumption in SAP Analytics Cloud, Microsoft Excel, and other clients, apps, and tools. For more information, see [Modeling Data in the Data Builder](Modeling-Data-in-the-Data-Builder/modeling-data-in-the-data-builder-5c1e3d4.md).
-   Modeling Data in the Business Builder - Users with a modeler role can use the *Business Builder* editors to combine, refine, and enrich *Data Builder* objects and expose lightweight, tightly-focused perspectives for consumption by SAP Analytics Cloud and Microsoft Excel. For more information, see [Modeling Data in the Business Builder](Buisiness-Builder/modeling-data-in-the-business-builder-3829d46.md).
