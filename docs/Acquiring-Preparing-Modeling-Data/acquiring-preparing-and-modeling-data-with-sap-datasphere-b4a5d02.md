# Acquiring, Preparing, and Modeling Data with SAP Datasphere

Users with the *DW Modeler* role can bring data into the *Data Builder*, combine it \(including with external data from the *Data Marketplace*\) and prepare it for consumption in SAP Analytics Cloud and other BI clients either directly or after further modeling in the *Business Builder*.

-   Creating, Finding, and Sharing Objects - All SAP Datasphere users use the *Repository Explorer* to browse objects. Modelers can create objects and otherwise act on them here or in the dedicated builder apps. Users with the *Catalog User* role can, additionally, browse the *Catalog* for trusted data assets that have been published there. For more information, see [Creating, Finding, and Sharing Objects](Creating-Finding-Sharing-Objects/creating-finding-and-sharing-objects-6c69b30.md).
-   Purchasing External Data - Users with the *DW Modeler* role can purchase external data from the *Data Marketplace* to combine with and enrich their internal data. For more information, see [Purchasing Data from Data Marketplace](purchasing-data-from-data-marketplace-4096fb8.md).
-   Acquiring and Preparing Data - Users with the *DW Modeler* role can import data directly into the *Data Builder* from connections and other sources, and use flows to replicate, extract, transform and load data. For more information, see [Acquiring Data in the Data Builder](Acquiring-and-Preparing-Data-in-the-Data-Builder/acquiring-data-in-the-data-builder-1f15a29.md).
-   Modeling Data in the Data Builder - Users with the *DW Modeler* role can add semantic information to their entities and expose them directly to clients, tools, and apps, or combine, refine, and enrich them in tightly-focused analytic models for consumption in SAP Analytics Cloud, MS Excel, and other clients, apps, and tools. For more information, see [Modeling Data in the Data Builder](Modeling-Data-in-the-Data-Builder/modeling-data-in-the-data-builder-5c1e3d4.md).
-   Modeling Data in the Business Builder - Users with the *DW Modeler* role can use the *Business Builder* editors to combine, refine, and enrich *Data Builder* objects and expose lightweight, tightly-focused perspectives for consumption by SAP Analytics Cloud and MS Excel. For more information, see [Modeling Data in the Business Builder](Buisiness-Builder/modeling-data-in-the-business-builder-3829d46.md).
