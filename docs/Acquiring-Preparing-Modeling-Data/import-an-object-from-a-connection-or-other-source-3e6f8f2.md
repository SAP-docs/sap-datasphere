# Import an Object from a Connection or Other Source

Drag objects from the *Sources* tab of the *Source Browser* to add them as sources in your data flow, graphical view, or SQL view. In an E/R model, you can add objects from any connections and other sources, and prepare them for use in other editors.

## Context

> ### Note:  
> In the data flow editor, tables taken from connections are simply connected to \(and not imported\).

## Procedure

1.  If the *Source Browser* panel is not visible on the left of the screen, click *Source Browser* in the toolbar to show it.

2.  Click the *Sources* tab.

    The *Sources* tab lists all the connections and other data sources that have been integrated to the space from which you can import tables. These can include: 

    -   *Connections* - Lists all the connections that have been created in the space \(see [Integrating Data via Connections](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/eb85e157ab654152bd68a8714036e463.html "Users with a space administrator or integrator role can create connections to SAP and non-SAP source systems, including cloud and on-premise systems and partner tools, and to target systems for outbound replication flows. Users with modeler roles can import data via connections for preparation and modeling in SAP Datasphere.") :arrow_upper_right:\).

        You can browse and search on up to 1,000 objects per connection. To browse all available objects, hover over any schema and click <span class="FPA-icons-V3">î˜˜</span> \(Import from Connection\) to open the *Import Objects from Connection* dialog \(see [Import Multiple Objects from a Connection](import-multiple-objects-from-a-connection-e720b13.md)\).

    -   Open SQL Schemas - Each Open SQL schema appears as a root node in this tab \(see [Integrating Data via Database Users/Open SQL Schemas](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/3de55a78a4614deda589633baea28645.html "Users with a space administrator role can create database users to read data exposed by the space and to write data to Open SQL schemas attached to space, providing a secure method for exchanging data with the space via ODBC access to the run-time SAP HANA Cloud database.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
    -   HDI Containers - Each SAP HDI container added to the space appears as a root node in this tab \(see [Exchanging Data with SAP HANA for SQL data warehousing HDI Containers](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/1aec7ca95af24208a61c1a444b249d95.html "Users with a space administrator role can use SAP HANA for SQL data warehousing to build calculation views and other SAP HANA Cloud HDI objects directly in the run-time SAP HANA Cloud database and then exchange data between HDI containers and SAP Datasphere spaces. SAP HANA for SQL data warehousing can be used to bring existing HDI objects into your SAP Datasphere environment, and to allow users familiar with the HDI tools to leverage advanced SAP HANA Cloud features.") :arrow_upper_right:\).

3.  Expand the source from which you want to import a table and then expand any sub-folders until you arrive at the table you want to import:

4.  Drag the table you want to import and drop it on the diagram canvas:

5.  In the *Import Table* dialog, accept the default business and technical names or overwrite them and then click *Import and Deploy*:

    The source is added to your diagram and is imported to the repository. From now on it is available to everyone in your space on the *Repository* tab of the *Source Browser*:

    -   Connections - Tables are imported as remote tables

        > ### Note:  
        > In the data flow editor, tables taken from connections are simply connected to \(and not imported\).

    -   Open SQL queries - Tables are imported as local tables
    -   HDI containers - Tables are imported as local tables
