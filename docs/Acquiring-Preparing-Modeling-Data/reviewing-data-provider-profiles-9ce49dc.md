# Reviewing Data Provider Profiles

Use the catalog *Data Providers* collection to search for data providers. You can see their profile details and find out which data products they offer.



From the catalog search page, you can select the *Data Providers* collection and then select one or more filters to narrow the search results. This collection is only available in the SAP Datasphere catalog.

The search results provides high-level information about a data provider, including their name and a short description. If you want to know more about a data provider, select their name to view their profile page that provides all legally required and additional information, such as company and contact information and general information about the data products offered, including the industry your data products belong to and the SAP applications that are related to your data products.

Data provider profiles are managed by the data provider themselves or by a content aggregator.

-   A data provider is a person or company that offers one or multiple data products.
-   A content aggregator is a company managing one or multiple data provider profiles and their available data products.

To learn more, see [Data Provider Vs Content Aggregator](https://help.sap.com/viewer/bb1899f0b39f415b9de29a845873d7af/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/ba1b703d905547b392c09b35c1028de1.html "Data Marketplace content can either be created by a data provider or a content aggregator.") :arrow_upper_right:.

For example, if you’re a content aggregator, you might want to review the data provider profile of a company you manage to ensure that their information is correct and their data offerings are current. If any changes are needed, go to the Data Sharing Cockpit to make them. For more information, see [Maintaining your Data Provider Profile](https://help.sap.com/viewer/bb1899f0b39f415b9de29a845873d7af/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/4d298f8654fe4a6c9b6a4399a9e14c77.html "Provide information as you would like to present it to consumers of Data Marketplace. Provide company and business contact information as well as general information about the data you offer.") :arrow_upper_right:.
