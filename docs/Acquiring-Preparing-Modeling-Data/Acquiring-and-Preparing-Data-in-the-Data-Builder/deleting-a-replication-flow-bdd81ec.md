# Deleting a Replication Flow

You can delete a replication flow if you do not need it anymore and thus free up capacity.

In the Data Builder, select the relevant replication flow and choose <span class="FPA-icons"></span> \(Delete\).

You can only delete replication flows that have the status *Completed* or *Stopped*.
