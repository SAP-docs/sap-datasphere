# Deleting a Replication Flow

You can delete a replication flow if you do not need it anymore and thus free up capacity.

In the Data Builder, select the relevant replication flow and choose <span class="FPA-icons-V3">î˜‹</span> \(Delete\).

If you delete a running replication flow, the system first stops the flow and then deletes it. However, the recommended approach is to first stop the replication flow by choosing *Stop* and then delete it.
