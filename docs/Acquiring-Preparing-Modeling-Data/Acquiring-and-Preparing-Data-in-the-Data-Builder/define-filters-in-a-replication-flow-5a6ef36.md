# Define Filters in a Replication Flow

Define filters to delimit the scope of your replication flow.



## Procedure

1.  Select the source object for which you want to define a filter.

2.  Choose*Add Projection*.

3.  On the *Filter* tab of the *Projections* dialog, select the column by which you want to filter from the list on the left.

    The key symbol next to a column name indicates a key field.

4.  Select the relevant condition and enter the relevant values.

    What options you have here depends on the replication objects you choose and their respective data types.

    For a string field, for example, you can only choose *equal to* and enter a value. For an integer field, you can use mathematical operators, such as *greater than*, and enter a numeric value.

5.  When you're done, choose *Add Expression*.

6.  Repeat steps 3 to 5 until you have defined all filters you need.

    -   More than one filter on different columns applies the AND operator.

    -   More than one filter on the same column applies the OR operator.

    -   The line at the bottom of the screen summarizes how all the filter expressions you defined work together.


    For example, filtering on the product ID 123 for the countries United States and Germany results in the following:

    \(PRODUCT\_ID = 123\) AND \(COUNTRY = 'US' OR COUNTRY = 'DE'\)

7.  Enter a name for your filter at the top of the screen, then click *OK*.
