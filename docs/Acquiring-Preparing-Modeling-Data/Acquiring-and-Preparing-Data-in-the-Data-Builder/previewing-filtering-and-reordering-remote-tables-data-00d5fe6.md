# Previewing, Filtering and Reordering Remote Tables Data

You have imported a remote table and want to preview and reorganize the data for your needs.

What you can do to preview or reorganize your data depends on the connection and the adapter.

> ### Caution:  
> Previewing data from a remote table with a large data volume may overload your source system, resulting in an out-of-memory error.

> ### Note:  
> In case your remote table has been shared from another space, some actions may be not possible. Again, it depends on the connection type and the adapters used.

For more information on remote tables and adapters, see [Replicating Data and Monitoring Remote Tables](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/4dd95d7bff1f48b399c8b55dbdd34b9e.html "In the Remote Tables monitor, you can find a remote table monitor per space. Here, you can copy data from remote tables that have been deployed in your space into SAP Datasphere, and you can monitor the replication of the data.

For more information on which connection types support data replication \(direct or scheduled replication\) and real-time replication, see [Integrating Data via Connections](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/eb85e157ab654152bd68a8714036e463.html "Users with a space administrator or integrator role can create connections to SAP and non-SAP source systems, including cloud and on-premise systems and partner tools, and to target systems for outbound replication flows.
