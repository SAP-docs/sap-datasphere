# Create a Calculated Column in a Data Flow

Add a new column in a projection operator and define the expression that will fill it with data.



## Procedure

1.  In the properties panel of the projection operator, choose <span class="FPA-icons-V3">î˜‰</span> \(Add New Calculated Column\) in the *Columns* section.

2.  Provide a name and data type for the column. Additional fields are displayed for the following data types:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Data Type
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Additional Field
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    string
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    \(Optional\) *Length*: Define the maximum number of characters that is allowed for the column.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    binary
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    \(Optional\) *Length*: Define the maximum number of characters that is allowed for the column.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    decimal
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Precision*: Define the maximum number of digits \(including Scale\) that is allowed for a value in the column.

    *Scale*: Define the maximum number of digits that is allowed after the decimal point for a value in the column.

    > ### Note:  
    > Precision must be greater than scale. For example, if Precision is 4 and Scale is 2, the value allowed for the column is XX.xx


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>

3.  In the *Expression* field, define the expression for the calculated column. You can build your expression by choosing from the *Functions* \(see [Function Reference for Data Transformation Language](https://help.sap.com/viewer/fd995896a5f841c696d2b6825d39f755/Cloud/en-US)\), *Columns*, *Input Parameters* \(see [Create an Input Parameter in a Data Flow](create-an-input-parameter-in-a-data-flow-a6fb3e7.md)\), and *Operators*.

    > ### Note:  
    > To validate your expression so that you can find any issues with it and fix them, click the *Validate* button.
    > 
    > -   In the expression, you must enclose a column name within double quotations and a constant string value within single quotations.
