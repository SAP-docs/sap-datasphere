# Creating a Task Chain

Group multiple tasks into a task chain and run them manually once, or periodically, through a schedule.



<a name="loiod1afbc2b9ee84d44a00b0b777ac243e1__prereq_ccw_sdc_gtb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   The DW Modeler role is required to create task chains as well as share task chains with other spaces. The additional DW Integrator role is required to run task chains shared from other spaces as well as set up email notification for completion of task chain runs. In addition, this role is required to run the activity *Delete All Records \(Mark as "Deleted"\)* in the case of local table with delta capture enabled. For more information, see [Standard Roles Delivered with SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/a50a51d80d5746c9b805a2aacbb7e4ee.html "SAP Datasphere is delivered with several standard roles. A standard role includes a predefined set of privileges and permissions.") :arrow_upper_right:. In addition to these two role privileges, when setting up email notifications, either the Team.Read or User.Read privilege is also required to display and add notification recipients from a list of current tenant members. See [Privileges and Permissions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/d7350c6823a14733a7a5727bad8371aa.html "A privilege represents a task or an area in SAP Datasphere and can be assigned to a specific role. The actions that can be performed in the area are determined by the permissions assigned to a privilege.") :arrow_upper_right:.

-   For SAP HANA Open SQL schema procedures to be available for users to include in a task chain, the schema’s owner must grant EXECUTE privileges to the space user for objects in the Open SQL schema. See [Allow the Space to Access the Open SQL Schema](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/7eaa370fe4624dea9f182ee9c9ab645f.html "To grant the space write privileges in the Open SQL schema and the ability to write data to target tables in the schema, use the GRANT_PRIVILEGE_TO_SPACE stored procedure. Once this is done, data flows running in the space can select tables in the Open SQL schema as targets and write data to them, and task chains can run procedures in the schema.") :arrow_upper_right:.
-   Objects must have been already deployed, so that they can be added to the task chain. Task chains must also be deployed to allow selection of tenant users or specify email addresses for notification of task chain completion.

-   Persisting of views may include one parameter that uses the default value defined with the view. Views must not have data access controls assigned to them.

-   If a data flow that has input parameters is included in a task chain, task chain runs will use default parameter values defined for the data flow.
-   A replication flow can be included in a task chain if all objects in the flow have load type *Initial Only*.




## Context

You can create task chains that include SAP Datasphere repository objects, that is, Remote Tables and Views, Local Tables, Intelligent Lookups, Data Flows, Replication Flows \(load type *Initial Only*\), and Transformation Flows. You can also include non-repository objects such as SAP HANA Open SQL schema procedures and SAP BW Bridge process chains. In addition, you can nest other existing, locally-created or shared task chains in other task chains, as well as share task chains you've created to other spaces.

n addition to the objects available from the Repository or Others tabs, you can also add two other additional objects to task chains that are only available from the task chain toolbar. The *API Task* object lets you configure and run API asks to access external systems. The *Notification Task* object lets you configure email notification for individual task chain tasks.

> ### Note:  
> For remote table and view objects included in a task chain, you have the option, by default, to replicate or persist the data associated with the corresponding remote tables or views. Or, you can choose to remove the replicated or persisted data by selecting that option in the *Activities* section of an object’s *Properties* detail display.
> 
> -   For remote tables, if you choose the *Remove Replicated Data* option and the remote table object already has data replicated using Snapshot Replication, the replicated data will be removed and the data will be read directly from the remote source and no longer from the repository. For more information, see [Replicating Data and Monitoring Remote Tables](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/4dd95d7bff1f48b399c8b55dbdd34b9e.html "In the Remote Tables monitor, you can find a remote table monitor per space. Here, you can copy data from remote tables that have been deployed in your space into SAP Datasphere, and you can monitor the replication of the data. You can copy or schedule copying the full set of data from the source, or you can set up replication of data changes in real-time via change data capturing (CDC).") :arrow_upper_right:. If the data is being replicated via Real Time Replication, the data will also be removed and the object’s data access method will be changed to Remote access. \(A log message will be displayed in the remote table's log to indicate that the data access type has been changed when the remote table object is run.\)
> 
> -   For views, if you choose the *Remove Persisted Data* option, data persistence will be removed and the view data will be read from the remote source and no longer from the repository. For more information, see [Persisting and Monitoring Views](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/9af04c990f294fd28c00f46763dd8b0d.html "From Data Integration Monitor > > Views , you can monitor views that have been created in the Data Builder. You can persist these views (direct run or via a schedule) to make them available locally to improve the performance when accessing your data. You can monitor the existing persisted views to keep control of your data sizing and free up memory space.") :arrow_upper_right:.
> 
> If replication and data removal tasks are both attempted to run at the same time, the tasks are given priority based on a first-come, first served basis.

When creating a task chain, you can create linear task chains in which one task is run after another. A succeeding task is only run once the previous task in the series has finished successfully with a *completed* status. The running of tasks in the series will not resume if the previous task has a *failed* status. You can also create task chains in which individual tasks are run in parallel and successful continuation of the entire task chain run depends on whether ANY or ALL parallel tasks are completed successfully.

> ### Note:  
> For optimal performance, it is recommended that you consider staggering the scheduled run time of tasks such as data flows or task chains that may contain these tasks. Make sure to distribute your work such as scheduling and running tasks. There isn't a specific numerical limit on how many tasks can be scheduled. There could be a resource distribution issue caused by too many tasks running at once. Check your system monitor to look at your workload distribution. For more information see, [Monitoring SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/28910cded17a42a0bf16225309cb8bf6.html "Users with an administrator role have access to various monitoring logs and views and can, if necessary, create database analysis users to help troubleshoot issues.") :arrow_upper_right: or [Persisted Views and Memory Consumption](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/e3d04951a4a344c28b25b2b1b13bf3d8.html "You want to persist a complex view and consider how it affects the memory consumption.") :arrow_upper_right:.

When creating or editing a task chain, you can also set up email notification for deployed task chains to notify selected users of task chain completion. After deploying a task chain, you can add tenant users or email addresses to notify individuals when task chain runs are completed.

You can monitor the status of task chain runs from the Data Integration Monitor. For more information, see [Monitoring Task Chains](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/4142201ec1aa49faad89a688a2f1852c.html "Monitor the status and progress of running and previously run task chains.") :arrow_upper_right:.

In addition to working with task chains in the editor, you can also:

-   List, create, read, update, and delete them using the `datasphere` command line interface \(see [Manage Modeling Objects and Tasks via the Command Line](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9b8363ae47c347de9a027c0e5567a37a/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/6f5c65f209004751aa48f9682ee2ec45.html "Users with a modeler role can use the datasphere command line interface to list, create, update, and delete modeling objects.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
-   Export and import them via the secure *Transport* app \(see [Transporting Content Between Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/df12666cf98e41248ef2251c564b0166.html "Users with an administrator or space administrator role can use the Transport app to transfer content between tenants via a private cloud storage area.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
-   Export and import them via CSN files \(see [Importing and Exporting Objects in CSN/JSON Files](../Creating-Finding-Sharing-Objects/importing-and-exporting-objects-in-csn-json-files-f8ff062.md)\).



## Procedure

1.  From the *Data Builder*, click *New Task Chain*.

2.  From the left-side panel, drag and drop a first object on to the task chain canvas from those available in the repository \(from the *Repository* tab\), or non-repository objects \(selected from the *Others* tab\).

    > ### Note:  
    > From the *Repository* tab, you can see the remote tables, views, intelligent lookups, data flow, replication flow, transformation flow objects and task chains that meet prerequisites and are available to be added to the task chain. Task chains you've shared or have been shared with you from another space are denoted by the <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Share\) icon following the task chain's business name. For more information on sharing and running shared task chains, see [Nest and Share Task Chains](nest-and-share-task-chains-8067b77.md).
    > 
    > From the *Others* tab, you can see the non-repository Open SQL schema procedures and BW Bridge process chains you can add to a task chain. For more information on adding Open SQL schema procedures from the Others tab, see [Run Open SQL Procedures in a Task Chain](run-open-sql-procedures-in-a-task-chain-59b9c77.md). For more information on adding BW Bridge process chains to a task chain, see [Run BW Bridge Process Chains in a Task Chain](run-bw-bridge-process-chains-in-a-task-chain-7d7d02a.md).
    > 
    > In addition to the objects available from the Repository or Others tabs, you can also add two other additional objects to task chains that are only available from the task chain toolbar. The *API Task* object lets you configure API Tasks to access external systems. \(For more information, see [Run API Tasks in a Task Chain](run-api-tasks-in-a-task-chain-9a8489e.md).\) The *Notification Task* object lets you configure email notification for individual task chain tasks. \(For more information, see [Configure Email Notification](configure-email-notification-7ff6a4e.md).\)

3.  Drag a second object on to the first object in the task chain. As you drag the object over the top of the first object, a context menu displays options *Add as New Task* \(the default\), *Replace Existing*, or *Add as Parallel* to place the new object in the linear arrangement of tasks in the task chain, or as a task in parallel with a selected task.

    Choosing the *Add as New Task* option automatically connects the new object task to the previous object task. The properties panel for the task chain is also updated with the added objects.

    > ### Note:  
    > Options on the task chain toolbar in the *Plus Sign* \(*\+*\) menu also let you add new task objects to the task chain. The *Add Placeholder after Selected Task* option places a new task object placeholder in the existing linear arrangement of tasks in the task chain. The *Add Parallel Branch after Selected Task* option places a new task object placeholder in parallel with the currently selected task. For more information on creating task chains with parallel task branches, see [Run Parallel Tasks in a Task Chain](run-parallel-tasks-in-a-task-chain-363ffe9.md).

4.  Continue adding remaining object tasks you want to include in the task chain.

    In addition to adding or replacing object tasks in a task chain, you can drag objects already on the task chain canvas to change the order in which tasks are run. By default, tasks in a task chain are displayed in a vertical direction, from top to bottom. On the left side of the task chain toolbar, the *Layout* menu provides options to let you change the orientation of tasks from Top to Bottom \(*Top-Bottom*\) to Left to Right \(*Left-Right*\).

5.  In the properties panel, specify a name for the task chain.

    *Repository Objects:*

    -   Remote table - Replicate

    -   Data flow - Run
    -   Replication Flow - Run
    -   Transformation flow - Run

        > ### Note:  
        > -   Merge: Add, update or delete data into the existing local table \(file\). Data updates are pushed by a replication flow or SAP BW to the inbound buffer \(specific folder in file storage\) of a target local table \(file\). To process data updates from this inbound buffer to the local table \(file\), and therefore make data visible, a merge task has to run..
        > -   Optimize: Improve data access performance by optimizing the layout of data in file storage \(for example by grouping small files into larger files\)..
        > -   Delete Records: Delete records from your local table \(file\). Under Settings, define what type of deletion you want:
        >     -   *Delete All Records \(Mark as Deleted\)*: Records will not be physically deleted but marked as deleted and filtered out when accessing the active records of the local table. They will still consume storage, and they can still be processed by other apps that consume them.
        >     -   *Delete previous versions \(Vacuum\), which are older than the specified number of days*: Records that meet your defined criteria will be permanently deleted. Default value is 90 days. Minimum authorized value is 7 so that records from the last 7 days cannot be deleted. In addition, only records that have been fully processed can be deleted. 
        >

        \[Optional\]. When you select one of these options, you can override the default *Apache Spark Application Settings* that were defined at space creation by your administrator.

    -   Task Chain - Run

    For remote table and view objects included in a task chain, the default option lets you replicate or persist the data associated with the remote table or view respectively. Or, you can choose to remove the replicated or persisted data.

    -   For remote tables, if you choose the *Remove Replicated Data* option and the remote table object already has data replicated using Snapshot Replication, that table's data will be removed. If the data is being replicated via Real Time Replication, the table's data will also be removed and the object’s data access method will be changed to Remote access. \(A log message will be displayed in the remote table log to indicate that the data access type has been changed when the remote table object is run.\)

    -   For views, if you choose the *Remove Persisted Data* option, that view's data will be removed.

    *Other \(Non-Repository\) Objects:*

    -   BW Process Chains - Run \(For more information, see [Run BW Bridge Process Chains in a Task Chain](run-bw-bridge-process-chains-in-a-task-chain-7d7d02a.md)\)
