# Creating a Transformation Flow

Create a transformation flow to load data from one or more source tables, apply transformations \(such as a join\), and output the result in a target table. You can load a full set of data from one or more source tables to a target table. You can add local tables and also remote tables located in BW Bridge spaces. Note that remote tables located in SAP BW bridge spaces must be shared with the SAP Datasphere space you are using to create your transformation flow. You can also load delta changes \(including deleted records\) from one source table to a target table.



## Context

A transformation flow run is a one-time event that completes when the relevant data is loaded to the target table successfully. You can run a transformation flow multiple times, for example if you are loading delta changes to the target table.

Creating a transformation flow involves two important steps:

-   Creating a graphical view transform or an SQL view transform to load data from source tables and to transform data.

-   Adding a target table to the transformation flow and mapping the columns from the graphical view transform or SQL view transform created in the first step to the target table.


> ### Note:  
> A transformation flow only supports the loading of data to a local table in the SAP Datasphere repository.

> ### Note:  
> A transformation flow generates internal SQL objects that must only be consumed by SAP Datasphere internal apps, and are not allowed for external data access.



## Procedure

1.  In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Data Builder*\), select a space if necessary, and click *New Transformation Flow* to open the editor. The system displays the *New Transformation Flow* screen.

2.  Create a graphical view transform or an SQL view transform to load data from source tables and to transform data. To create a graphical view transform, click the *Graphical View Transform* button \(see [Create a Graphical View Transform](create-a-graphical-view-transform-c65e37c.md)\). To create an SQL view transform, click the *SQL View Transform* button \(see [Create an SQL View Transform](create-an-sql-view-transform-775e0ab.md)\).

3.  Click the *Back* button to return to the *Transformation Flow Editor*. Add or create a target table that the transformation flow will write its data to \(see [Add or Create a Target Table](add-or-create-a-target-table-0950746.md)\).

4.  Click the *Details* button to display the *Transformation Flow Properties* panel.

    In the *General* section, you can view the following properties:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Property
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Description
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Business Name / Technical Name
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Information to identify the transformation flow.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Package
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Select the package to which the object belongs. 

    Packages are used to group related objects in order to facilitate their transport between tenants.

    > ### Note:  
    > Once a package is selected, it cannot be changed here. Only a user with the DW Space Administrator role \(or equivalent privileges\) can modify a package assignment in the *Packages* editor.

    For more information, see [Creating Packages to Export](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/24aba84ceeb3416881736f70f02e3a0a.html "Users with the DW Space Administrator role can create packages to model groups of related objects for transport between tenants. Modelers can add objects to packages via the Package field, which appears in editors when a package is created in their space. Once a package is complete and validated, the space administrator can export it to the Content Network. The structure of your package is preserved and, as the objects it contains evolve, you can easily export updated versions of it.") :arrow_upper_right:.

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Status
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    The deployment and error status of the object. For more information, see [Saving and Deploying Objects](../saving-and-deploying-objects-7c0b560.md).

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Load Type 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Select the relevant load type. 

    The following options are possible:

    -   Initial Only

        Loads the full set of data to the target table.

    -   Initial and Delta

        The first time you run the transformation flow, the system will load all the full set of data to the target table. For subsequent runs, the system will only load delta changes to the target table.

        If you want to load delta changes from a source table, you need to ensure that the value of the option *Delta Capture* is *On* for both the source table and for the target table.

    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Run Status 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    View the details of the last run. 

    You can view the details of the last run. You can view the date and time of the run as well as the status, for example *Completed*. In addition, you can choose the *Schedule* button to run your transformation flow at later time, or on regular basis. For more information, see [Running a Flow](running-a-flow-5b591d4.md). You can also open the transformation flow run in the *Data Integration Monitor*.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    In the *Run Status* section, you can view the status of the transformation flow run.

5.  Click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Save\). A dialog box appears. Enter a business name and a technical name for your transformation flow.

    When you enter a business name, the system automatically suggests a corresponding technical name, but you can change the technical name if required. Both names must be unique within the space you work in.

6.  Click <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(Deploy\) to make your transformation flow ready to run.

    -   Newly created transformation flows are deployed for the first time.

    -   Transformation flows that have changes to deploy are redeployed.
