# Processing Changes to Source and Target Tables

If source or target tables of your transformation flow are modified, you can review the changes and decide how your transformation flow should handle the changes.

It is only possible to review target table changes in the *Transformation Flow Editor*. For more information, see [Process Target Changes in the Transformation Flow Editor](process-target-changes-in-the-transformation-flow-editor-75ab3ef.md).

It is only possible to review source table changes in the *Graphical View Editor* or in the *SQL View Editor*. If a source table of your transformation flow is modified, then the next time you open the transformation flow a message will inform you that the table was modified. However, depending on the type of view used by the transformation flow, you will need to either edit the graphical view transform or the SQL view transform to view the details of the change. For more information, see [Process Source Changes in the Graphical View Editor](process-source-changes-in-the-graphical-view-editor-098ada1.md) and [Process Source Changes in the SQL View Editor](process-source-changes-in-the-sql-view-editor-74e6002.md).
