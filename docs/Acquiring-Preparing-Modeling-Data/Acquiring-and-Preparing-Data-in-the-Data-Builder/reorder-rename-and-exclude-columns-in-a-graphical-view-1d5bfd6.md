# Reorder, Rename, and Exclude Columns in a Graphical View

Add a *Projection* node to rename, reorder, or exclude columns.



## Procedure

1.  Select a node in order to display its context tools, and click <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(Rename/Exclude Columns\).

    ![](images/Graphical_View_Editor_-_Projection_0cf3eea.gif) A projection node is created, its symbol is selected, and its properties are displayed in the side panel.

2.  Optional. Rename the node in its side panel to clearly identify it. This name can be changed at any time and can contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

3.  The *Columns* list displays the columns that are available. You can filter the list with the *Search* box and reorder it.

4.  Modify the *Columns* list as appropriate. You can:

    -   Reorder a column by dragging and dropping it in the list below *Columns*.
    -   Rename a column by clicking <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Menu\), and selecting *Change Name* to open the *Change Name* dialog. Edit the business and/or technical names as appropriate and click *Save*.

        > ### Note:  
        > By default, SAP Datasphere displays the business names of your objects. To show technical names instead, click *Profile* \> *Settings*, select the *UI Settings* tab, and then select *Show Technical Name*.

    -   Exclude a column by clicking its <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Menu\) button, and selecting *Exclude Column*.

        To select multiple columns for exclusion, press [Ctrl\] while selecting them. Alternatively, click *Select All* and press [Ctrl\] while deselecting columns.


5.  Click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Preview Data\) to open the *Data Preview* panel and review the data output by this node. For more information, see [Viewing Object Data](../viewing-object-data-b338e4a.md).
