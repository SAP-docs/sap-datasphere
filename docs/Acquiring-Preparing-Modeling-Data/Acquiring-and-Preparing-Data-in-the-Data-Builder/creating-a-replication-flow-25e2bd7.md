# Creating a Replication Flow

Create a replication flow to copy multiple data assets from a source to a target.



## Context

You can use replication flows to copy data from the following source objects:

-   CDS views \(in ABAP-based SAP systems\) that are enabled for extraction

-   Objects from ODP providers, such as extractors or SAP BW artifacts \(from any SAP system that is based on SAP NetWeaver and has a suitable version of the DMIS add-on, see SAP Note [3412110](https://me.sap.com/notes/3412110)\)

-   Tables that have a primary key.


CDS views and ODP artifacts that do not have a primary key can be used as the source for a replication flow if certain prerequisites are met. For more information, see [Object Without Primary Key As Source Objects for Replication Flows](object-without-primary-key-as-source-objects-for-replication-flo-2267a9f.md).

For more information about available connection types, sources, and targets, see [Connection Types Supporting Replication Flows](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATASPHERE/be5967d099974c69b77f4549425ca4c0/94562426f30c475286f50a1e2b45e743.html?connection_overview-rf=yes%20(source)&connection_overview-rf=yes%20(target)&connection_overview-rf=yes%20(source%20and%20target)&connection_overview-rf=via%20connection%20type%20SAP%20ABAP%20Connections%20(source)).

> ### Note:  
> To make sure that you have the most up-to-date information and important considerations regarding replication flows, please read SAP Note [3297105](https://me.sap.com/notes/3297105) **before** you start creating a replication flow.
> 
> In addition to working with flows in the editor, you can also:
> 
> -   List, create, read, update, and delete them using the `datasphere` command line interface \(see [Manage Modeling Objects and Tasks via the Command Line](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9b8363ae47c347de9a027c0e5567a37a/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/6f5c65f209004751aa48f9682ee2ec45.html "Users with a modeler role can use the datasphere command line interface to list, create, update, and delete modeling objects.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
> -   Export and import them via the secure *Transport* app \(see [Transporting Content Between Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/df12666cf98e41248ef2251c564b0166.html "Users with an administrator or space administrator role can use the Transport app to transfer content between tenants via a private cloud storage area.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
> -   Export and import them via CSN files \(see [Importing and Exporting Objects in CSN/JSON Files](../Creating-Finding-Sharing-Objects/importing-and-exporting-objects-in-csn-json-files-f8ff062.md)\).

> ### Restriction:  
> Replication flows do not support input parameters.

## Procedure

1.  In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Data Builder*\), select a space if necessary, and click *New Replication Flow* to open the editor.

2.  Select a source connection and a source container, then add source objects \(see [Add the Source for a Replication Flow](add-the-source-for-a-replication-flow-7496380.md)\).

    The side panel shows the properties of your replication flow. Complete the missing information as appropriate:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Property

    <tr>
    <td valign="top">

    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Enter a descriptive name to help users identify the object. This name can be changed at any time.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Technical Name

    <td valign="top">
    
    Package
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Select the package to which the object belongs. 

    Packages are used to group related objects in order to facilitate their transport between tenants.

    > ### Note:  
    > Once a package is selected, it cannot be changed here. Only a user with the DW Space Administrator role \(or equivalent privileges\) can modify a package assignment in the *Packages* editor.

    For more information, see [Creating Packages to Export](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/24aba84ceeb3416881736f70f02e3a0a.html "Users with the DW Space Administrator role can create packages to model groups of related objects for transport between tenants. Modelers can add objects to packages via the Package field, which appears in editors when a package is created in their space. Once a package is complete and validated, the space administrator can export it to the Content Network. The structure of your package is preserved and, as the objects it contains evolve, you can easily export updated versions of it.") :arrow_upper_right:.

    <td valign="top">
    
    \[only relevant for ABAP-based source systems\]. Select the best content type to use when loading data from an ABAP-based system.

    You can choose between 2 content types:

    -   *Template Type*: The data types used in the source table will be applied in the target table.
    -   *Native Type* \(default\): Different data types will be applied to the target table. A string data type will be used for the date column in the target table, and a decimal data type will be used for the timestamp column to the target table.

    > ### Example:  
    > Your source table contains a date column that doesn't have values in ISO format. If you select the content type *Template Type* your replication flow run will fail with an error because the target table will expect data in ISO format. You'd better select the *Native Type* to run the replication flow, so that the data type will be turned into string.

    > ### Note:  
    > -   This option is available only for replication flows created from wave 2025.04.
    > -   It's best to use it for new targets, or for existing targets but only if you are certain about the existing column data types in the target. Otherwise, the replication flow deployment or run will fail due to a column data type mismatch between the source and target.
    > -   You can modify the content type later but with some restrictions. As the content type selection is at replication flow level, changing it will affect the source column data types \(date, time, and timestamp\) for all existing replication objects in the replication flow.

When new data appears in the inbound buffer, a merge task is automatically run and data is updated in your target local table \(file\).

    > ### Note:  
    > The option is enabled by default when you create a new replication with SAP Datasphere as target and load type *Initial and Delta*. For replication flows created before the option was available, you can still manually enable it \(and a redeployment will be needed\).

    When you deploy your replication flow, it gets saved in the shared repository and is available for other users to view, import, or modify.

    When deploying your replication flow, the system does a series of validation checks and outputs an error message if it finds an issue in the flow configuration.
