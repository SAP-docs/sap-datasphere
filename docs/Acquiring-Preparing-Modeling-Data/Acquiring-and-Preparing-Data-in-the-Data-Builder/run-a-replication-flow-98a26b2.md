# Run a Replication Flow

Once your flow is configured and deployed, you can run it.



To run your flow, you can:

-   Click *Run* to start an immediate run.
-   Schedule a run from the Flows Monitor. See [Working With Existing Replication Flow Runs](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/da62e1ee746448e8bc043e1be4377cbe.html "You can pause a replication flow run and resume it later, or stop it completely when it's no longer needed. You can also schedule, monitor premium outbound volume, and configure email notifications for replication flow failures. For more information on how to make changes to an existing replication flow in the Data Builder, see .") :arrow_upper_right:.
-   Add it to a task chain. For more information, see [Creating a Task Chain](creating-a-task-chain-d1afbc2.md).

Once completed, the *Run Status* section in the property panel is updated. From the *Flows* monitor, you can check details of your runs, and perform other actions on your flows. For more information, see [Monitoring Flows](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f36ca35bc6145e4acdef6b4d852d560/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/b661ea0766a24c7d839df950330a89fd.html "In the Flows monitor, you can find all the deployed flows per space.") :arrow_upper_right:.
