# Process Source Changes in the SQL View Editor

If one or more of the source tables of your SQL view transform is modified, then the next time you edit the SQL view transform you can view any changes by viewing the relevant validation messages.



## Procedure

1.  If a source change has generated warnings or errors in your SQL view transform, you can view any changes by viewing the relevant validation messages.

2.  Click the *Validate SQL* button and review and correct any errors that appear in the *Errors* panel.

3.  Review all information and warning messages to ensure that they do not adversely impact the output of your SQL view transform.

4.  Click the *Back* button to return to the *Transformation Flow Editor*, and then save and deploy the transformation flow.
