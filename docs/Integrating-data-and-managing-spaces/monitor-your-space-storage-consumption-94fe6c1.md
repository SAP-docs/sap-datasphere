## Prerequisites

To monitor the storage consumption of your space, you must have a scoped role that grants you access to your space with the following privileges:

-   *Data Warehouse General* \(`-R------`\) - To access SAP Datasphere.

The *DW Space Administrator* role template, for example, grants these privileges.
