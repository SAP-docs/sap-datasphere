# Exchanging Data with SAP HANA for SQL Data Warehousing HDI Containers

Users with a space administrator role can use SAP HANA for SQL data warehousing to build calculation views and other SAP HANA Cloud HDI objects directly in the run-time SAP HANA Cloud database and then exchange data between HDI containers and SAP Datasphere spaces. SAP HANA for SQL data warehousing can be used to bring existing HDI objects into your SAP Datasphere environment, and to allow users familiar with the HDI tools to leverage advanced SAP HANA Cloud features.



## Context

To enable SAP HANA for SQL data warehousing on your SAP Datasphere tenant, a user with administrator privileges must have mapped your tenant to your SAP Business Technology Platform account \(see [Enable SAP HANA for SQL data warehousing on Your SAP Datasphere Tenant](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/e9a287849ccf41bb8a132d12dd3fdc8f.html "Use SAP HANA for SQL data warehousing to build calculation views and other SAP HANA Cloud HDI objects directly in your SAP Datasphere run-time database and then exchange data between your HDI containers and your SAP Datasphere spaces.

The integrated SAP HANA for SQL data warehousing approach allows you to add HDI containers to your space and exchange data between them:

-   Bring data from calculation views and other objects built in your HDI container into your SAP Datasphere space via local tables and data flows \(see [Add an HDI Container and Access its Objects in Your Space](add-an-hdi-container-and-access-its-objects-in-your-s-5d55da5.md)\).

    ![HDI Container Objects are Sources for Space](images/HDI_as_Source_201d2a8.png)

-   Use data exposed from your SAP Datasphere space as a source for calculation views and flowgraphs built in your HDI container \(see [Consume Space Objects in Your HDI Container](consume-space-objects-in-your-hdi-container-656eebc.md)\).

-   Select tables in your HDI container as targets for your SAP Datasphere data flows \(see [Allow Your Space to Write to Your HDI Container](allow-your-space-to-write-to-your-hdi-container-aa3627f.md)\).
