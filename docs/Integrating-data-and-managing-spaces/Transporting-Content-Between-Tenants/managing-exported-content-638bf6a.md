# Managing Exported Content

If you've exported packages for sharing with other tenants, or have edit or delete permissions for another tenant's exports, you can work on them in the *Manage Packages* page.

In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons"></span> \(*Transport*\)** \> **<span class="FPA-icons"></span> \(*Export*\) and then click the *My Content* folder to display the list of packages that you have exported and those from other systems that you have permission to edit or delete. 

For packages:

-   To get an overview of a package, select its name.
-   To edit the contents or details of a package and export it again, select the checkbox next to it and select :pencil2:. If you need to change the content, set the *Modify Content* switch to *ON* from the *Choose Content* page. Otherwise, leave this switch off. Then, follow the steps in [Exporting Content for Sharing with Other Tenants](exporting-content-for-sharing-with-other-tenants-44e775c.md).
-   To change the sharing destinations for a package, select the checkbox next to it and select <span class="SAP-icons"></span> Share. Follow the steps for setting access rights in [Exporting Content for Sharing with Other Tenants](exporting-content-for-sharing-with-other-tenants-44e775c.md).
-   To delete packages, select the checkboxes next to them and choose :wastebasket:. The packages are removed and can't be imported or edited from any tenant. Each tenant that imported the package will still have access to the content itself, though.

For folders:

-   To create a new folder, select :file_folder: and type a name and description.

-   To share a folder and all its contents, select the checkbox next to a folder and select <span class="SAP-icons"></span> Share. See the access steps in [Exporting Content for Sharing with Other Tenants](exporting-content-for-sharing-with-other-tenants-44e775c.md) for more information.
-   To delete a folder and all its contents, select the checkbox next to a folder and select :wastebasket:. The folder and its contents will be removed for any tenants they were shared with.
