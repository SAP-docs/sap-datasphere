# Understanding Statuses and Substatuses

When you run an activity \(replicate a remote table, persist a view, etc..\), the progress of the task is monitored using statuses and substatuses. Statuses and substatuses are available in the relevant editors as well as in the *System Monitor*.

In SAP Datasphere , the activities can take a minimum of 3 main statuses:

-   *Running* or *Loading*: The task is currently running.
-   *Completed* or *Available*: The task has completed successfully.
-   *Failed* or *Error*: Something goes wrong during the task run and it could not be completed. Go to the details screen of your run and check the logs to identify to issue.

Depending on your activity, there might exist additional statuses. For more information, see [Replicating Data and Monitoring Remote Tables](replicating-data-and-monitoring-remote-tables-4dd95d7.md), [Persisting and Monitoring Views](persisting-and-monitoring-views-9af04c9.md), [Monitoring Flows](monitoring-flows-b661ea0.md), [Monitoring Remote Queries](monitoring-remote-queries-806d7f0.md) and [Monitoring Task Chains](monitoring-task-chains-4142201.md).

Statuses are sometimes combined with substatuses:

<td valign="top">

*FAIL\_CONSENT\_INVALIDATED*

</td>
<td valign="top">

This task or task chain could not be executed, typically due to a change in the Identity Provider configuration of the tenant. In that case, no new task jobs or task chains can be run or scheduled in the name of the affected user. If the assigned user still exists in the new IdP, revoke the scheduling consent and then grant it again. If the assigned user no longer exists, assign a new task job or task chain owner and provide the required task scheduling consent. See the following SAP note [3089828](https://me.sap.com/notes/3089828) for more information.
