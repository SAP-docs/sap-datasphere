# Cancel a Transformation Flow Run

You want to cancel a transformation flow that is running.



## Context

You can use the *Cancel Run* button to stop a transformation flow run that is currently running. This button is available until the run ends.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to *Data Integration Monitor* \> *Flows*.

2.  Navigate to the run details of your transformation flow by clicking <span class="SAP-icons-V5">îƒ£</span> \(Details\) for the relevant flow.

    The *Run Details* page opens. It shows the runs of the flow in the left panel and their corresponding messages in the right panel. Under *Runs*, you can view the status of the transformation flow runs \(the *Run* activity\) and also the status of any attempts to cancel a transformation flow run \(the *Cancel* activity\).

3.  To stop a run that is currently running, select the relevant run and click the *Cancel Run* button.

    If the run has been canceled successfully, the status of the transformation flow run will have the value *Failed \(Canceled\)*.

    Canceling a transformation flow involves rolling back database transactions. Therefore, it might take some time until the transformation flow is canceled and the status changes to *Failed \(Canceled\)*.

    > ### Caution:  
    > For a transformation flow in a file space, when you cancel a run, it stops where it is, and does not roll back what has already been processed. If you restart the run later, it will restart from the beginning, not where it has stopped.
