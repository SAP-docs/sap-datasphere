# Creating Partitions for Your Persisted Views

From the *Views*- Details screen, you can create partitions on columns from your dataset and break your data down into smaller and more manageable parts to enable persistency on views with large data volume.

Persisting views with larger data volumes without having out-of-memory errors or high memory peaks can sometimes be a challenge for Data modelers. To avoid such situations, you can create partitions when persisting a view and thus enable partitioned data transfer of large datasets for supported connection types.

> ### Note:  
> For this action, *Data Builder* \(*Read*\) privilege is required which is not included in the *DW Integrator* role. To perform this action, ask your tenant administrator to assign your user to a scoped role that is based either on the *DW Space Administrator* role or on a custom role that includes the following required privileges: *Data Warehouse Data Integration* \(*Read*, *Update*, *Execute*\) and *Data Builder* \(*Read*\).

> ### Caution:  
> Some adapters used by the connected sources are not able to push down the filters for the partitioning. Thus, performance can be impacted by the number of partitions created.

You can create partitions from the *Views* – Details screen:

1.  Click <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> for the view in virtual access mode you would like to persist and for which you need to create partitions for.
2.  Go to the *Partitions* tab and click *Define Partitions*.

## Selecting a Column

Select a column from the list, which will then become the partitioning column.

The columns available for selection are a subset of all view output columns. Some columns can be excluded because:

-   Supported data types include:

    -   String
    -   Integer, Integer 64, Decimal, hana.SMALLINT, hana.TINYINT
    -   Date, DateTime, Time, Timestamp
    -   Binary

    For more information, see [Partitioning Limits](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD_DATABASE/f9c5015e72e04fffa14d7d4f7267d897/8dd866a688ec4914a074727a2c800142.html) in the *SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database* documentation.

-   You can't select a column containing analytical measures as partitioning-columns, only columns containing dimensions can be used as partitioning columns.
-   If you select a non-key column to define your partitions, you must ensure that the column value of a record in the source data is not changed while the view is persisted. Otherwise, data loading may fail because a record with the same key is persisted in two different partitions.

> ### Note:  
> Partitioning is not recommended on columns that stem from remote tables using ABAP adapter with ODP, as related filter conditions are not pushed to the source. Instead, use remote table partitioning. The changes will be reflected only after a new data replication \(snapshot or scheduled\), or a real-time data replication. For more details, see [Partitioning Remote Table Data Loads](partitioning-remote-table-data-loads-a218d27.md). For connections using OData adapter, Camel JDBC adapter, or Cloud Data Integration adapter, partitioning may not have the desired effect as the related adapters have only limited capabilities and do may not push selections on partitioning intervals to the source system.

You can either select on a column that suits your business case, or switch on the option *Rate Column Suitability*:

![](images/Select_Column_For_Partitioning_8ac6d94.png)

It runs a technical analysis of your view definition to calculate the level of suitability for partitioning for each column. For example, calculated columns or columns with moving values \(such as last changed date\) are not suitable as it might be difficult to do a reliable partitioning on such data.

In a first step, general findings are displayed:

![](images/Suitable_Partitioning_Columns_1_c967fcb.png)

In a 2nd step, the columns are sorted by their partitioning suitability, and additional information is displayed:

-   *Rating*: It shows the suitability column rating. Possible values can be good, intermediate or bad.
-   *Details*: It shows additional details about important factors that influence the suitability for each column to help you with your choice. It can be one message or multiple messages.

## Defining Intervals for Your Partitions

Create the number of desired partitions by clicking <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(Add Partitions\) 

Enter an interval for each of them.

> ### Caution:  
> Intervals must not overlap

Check the *Locked* option if you don't want to update a partition in the next run.

> ### Caution:  
> If locked partitions contain data filtered by authorizations provided by data access controls, you need to unlock partitions and load a new snaphot of data, whenever these authorizations are changed.

An *OTHERS* partition is set by default. It contains data that is not covered by your defined intervals . For example, if rows have been inserted or modified since your last data persistence and they now don’t match any of the defined intervals. This *OTHERS* partitions can't be locked.

> ### Note:  
> -   Partitioning requires an in-depth knowledge of the values that are used or are valid for the chosen partitioning column.
> 
> -   Negative values are not valid for partition bounds of numeric columns and will be converted to 0 at runtime.
> 
> -   The low bound must be lower than the high bound. The order is checked according to the type of the partition column. Example: for string-like columns, '90' <= DOC\_ID < '100' is not valid, whereas '090' <= DOC\_ID < '100' is valid.
> 
> -   Values entered in the bounds for ABAP ODP remote tables must match the ABAP internal format: for example, enter "20210714" if the date is "July 14, 2021".

> ### Caution:  
> Once the partitions are created and the view is persisted, don't change data type of the column you have used to create the partition: if the data type is changed, it deletes the partitioning data.

## Locking Partitions to Avoid Unnecessary Data Loads

When you think the data will no longer change, or no change is expected for a while, you can check this option to avoid unnecessary data load.

In the example below, I defined 2 partitions as *Locked* \(partitions 2 and 3\):

![](images/Locking_Partitions_32cae47.png)

When I load a new snapshot, only partitions 1, 4 and OTHERS are refreshed:

![](images/Message_Locked_Partitions_Defined_6d6de8f.png)

> ### Note:  
> If you change the partition definition, you can lock unchanged partitions to avoid unnecessary data loads. In the case of adding partitions, if you lock the unchanged partitions, only the new partitions will be loaded \(Locking new partitions is ineffective, as they need to be updated once after they are introduced. They will only be locked in the subsequent runs.\)
> 
> A full data load will happen for the following cases:
> 
> -   You have no locked partitions.
> -   You have changed the partitioning column. A full snapshot will happen at next data load.

## Refreshing Single or Multiple Partitions

In some cases, you might want to refresh data for a single or for multiple partitions only, independently if they are locked or not. To do so, select the desired partitions and click *Load Selected Partitions*.

> ### Example:  
> In the example below, I have selected 2 partitions. Partition 1 is not locked and partition 2 is locked:
> 
> ![](images/Select_PartitionsToUpdate_a04c46a.png)
> 
> Only the selected partitions are updated:
> 
> ![](images/Selected_Partitions_Updated_3c25ff1.png)

> ### Note:  
> If you change the partition definition, then the next load will be a full load. No manual load will be possible, and the *Load Selected Partitions* button will be disabled.
