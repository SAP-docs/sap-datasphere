# Pause or Resume a Scheduled Task

Using options available for creating, editing, and removing task scheduling, you can pause or resumed previously scheduled data integration tasks such as remote table replication, persisting views, data flow or task chain execution.

After previously scheduling a task, you can select *Schedule* \> *Pause Schedule* to pause the next schedule run of a task, or select *Schedule* \> *Resume Schedule* to resume a schedule previously paused.

If you pause a schedule, when you return to the task display, the *Frequency* column displays *Paused* for the selected task, and the Next Run column is cleared of any future scheduled runs. The defined schedule for future scheduled runs is still saved, however, so you can simply go back later and resume the schdule to run future scheduled task again.
