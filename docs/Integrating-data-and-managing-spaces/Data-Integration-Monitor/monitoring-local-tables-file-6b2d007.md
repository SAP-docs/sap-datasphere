# Monitoring Local Tables \(File\)

Monitor your local tables \(file\). Check how and when they were last updated and if new data has still to be merged.

## Prerequisites

To monitor local tables \(file\), you must have a scoped role that grants you access to the space with the following privileges:

-   *Data Warehouse General* \(`-R------`\) - To access SAP Datasphere.
-   *Data Warehouse Data Integration* \(`-R------`\) - To view data integration task logs in the *Data Integration Monitor* app.

-   *Data Warehouse Data Integration* \(`--U-----`\) - To manually run data integration tasks.

-   *Data Warehouse Data Integration* \(`----E---`\) - To schedule data integration tasks.


The *DW Integrator* role template, for example, grants these privileges. For more information, see [Privileges and Permissions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/d7350c6823a14733a7a5727bad8371aa.html "A privilege represents a task or an area in SAP Datasphere and can be assigned to a specific role. The actions that can be performed in the area are determined by the permissions assigned to a privilege.") :arrow_upper_right: and [Standard Roles Delivered with SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/a50a51d80d5746c9b805a2aacbb7e4ee.html "SAP Datasphere is delivered with several standard roles. A standard role includes a predefined set of privileges and permissions.") :arrow_upper_right:.

## Monitoring Local Tables \(File\)

> ### Note:  
> For additional information on working with data in the object store, see SAP note [3538038](https://me.sap.com/notes/3538038).
> 
> The object store cannot be enabled in SAP Datasphere tenants provisioned prior to version 2021.03. To request the migration of your tenant, see SAP note [3268282](https://me.sap.com/notes/3268282).

Local tables can be used as source data or target data by SAP Datasphere apps. As a Data Integrator you might want to monitor all local tables \(file\) deployed in your space and check how and when data has been last updated and if some data must still be merged.

Go to *Data Integration Monitor* \> *Local Tables \(Files\)*. All local tables \(file\) that have been created in the *Data Builder* are listed. For more information on local tables \(file\), see [Creating a Local Table (File)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/24f836070a704022a40c15442163e5cf/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/d21881b121bc4703861be6ead4aea2ab.html "Create a local table (file) to store data in the object store. Load data to your local table (file) via replication flows and transform the data with transformation flows.") :arrow_upper_right:.

The monitor displays the following properties:

Status of the data merge.

Data updates are waiting in the Inbound Buffer until they are merged.

They can have the following status:

-   Running: a merge task is still running.
-   Failed: Last merge run task has failed. You might need to check the log for more details.
-   Merged: All data have been merged with the last merge task.
-   New Data: Data are waiting to be merged.
-   Empty: There is no new data waiting in the inbound buffer.
