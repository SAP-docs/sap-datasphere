# Replicate Data Changes in Real-Time

Use real-time replication to copy the data changes from your source object in real-time into SAP Datasphere.



<a name="loio441d327ead5c49d580d8600301735c83__prereq_j3v_jmg_h4b"/>

## Prerequisites

> ### Note:  
> Availability of real-time / trigger based replication depends on the connection type. For more information on which connection types support real-time replication, see [Integrating Data via Connections](../Integrating-Data-Via-Connections/integrating-data-via-connections-eb85e15.md).

-   The object in the source has to be enabled for change data capture \(CDC\).

-   If the database table in the source is CDC enabled but the remote table has been deployed before real-time replication was possible with SAP Datasphere, you have to re-deploy the table to allow real-time replication. You can re-deploy the table in the remote table editor in the *Data Builder*.

-   For source views, real-time replication ist not supported.

-   For ABAP Dictionary tables, real-time replication is not supported.

-   For ABAP ODP sources, real-time replication is supported for in the following cases:

    -   ODP-BW: InfoProviders with a change log. This can be:

        -   DataStore objects \(advanced\) with data activation and change log \(object type ADSO\)

        -   Standard DataStore objects \(classic\) \(object type ODSO\)

        -   InfoObjects


        > ### Note:  
        > To properly display real-time capability for ODP-BW InfoProviders in SAP Datasphere, please update your SAP BW to:
        > 
        > -   SAP BW 7.4: Support Package Stack 23 or higher \(see [SAPKW74023](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/supportpackage/SAPKW74023)\)
        > 
        > -   SAP BW 7.5: Support Package Stack 17 or higher \(see [SAPK-75017INSAPBW](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/supportpackage/SAPK-75017INSAPBW)\)

    -   ODP-CDS: For all ABAP CDS views with primary key and that are delta-enabled

        > ### Note:  
        > If you apply filters to replicate your remote table, you must apply them on primary key fields only. Indeed, delete operations on ABAP CDS Views are only recorded with their key fields in the Operational Delta Queue \(ODQ\), but no content is recorded for other field types. In case of filtering on non-key fields, there is strong risk that deletions are not propagated consistently to the target remote table.

See [SAP Blogs](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/12/16/cds-based-data-extraction-part-ii-delta-handling/)\]: "In case of a DELETE operation the job generates an empty record with just the key field\(s\) filled, sets the deletion indicator and hands them over to ODQ".

    -   ODP-SAPI: For all extractors that are delta enabled \(delta method ADD\* not allowed\) and have a primary key. For more information, see [CDS Views Enabled for Data Extraction](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/8308e6d301d54584a33cd04a9861bc52/b7a5b8b72d3643b7a8ecf4cd695e0791.html).

        See the blog [Finding the right CDS Extractor in SAP S/4HANA](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/07/finding-the-right-cds-extractor-in-sap-s-4hana/) \(published in January 2022\).

        > ### Note:  
        > For an overview of all extractors released for ODP replication \(ODP SAPI\), see SAP note [2232584](https://me.sap.com/notes/2232584).


-   For remote tables using an SAP HANA smart data access connection \(SAP HANA on-premise via Cloud Connector or SAP HANA Cloud\), you can replicate your data changes in real-time but with some restrictions as some remote object types are not supported:

    -   Remote object needs to be a table of type "COLUMN TABLE" \(other table types like Row Tables or Virtual Tables not supported\)
    -   Some data types and SAP HANA table features are not supported. For more information, see [Unsupported Data Types and Other Limitations](https://help.sap.com/viewer/477aa413a36c4a95878460696fcc8896/latest/en-US/06f6eb4859894432a0416cbb49073f32.html?q=Unsupported%20data%20types%20and%20other%20limitations).

    > ### Note:  
    > You can’t pause the replication for connections if SAP HANA smart data access is used.

-   For remote tables connected via an SAP HANA smart data integration Cloud Data Integrator \(CDI\) adapter, we recommend that you use a DP Agent version equal or higher than 2.6.1.

## Procedure

1.  Go to *Data Integration Monitor* and select the space in which the relevant remote table resides.

2.  Go to the *Remote Tables*.

3.  Select the remote table that you want to replicate data for.

4.  When changing from scheduled data replication to real-time replication, you must select *Data Replication* \> *Remove Replicated Data* to delete the current replicated data from the replica table and delete the schedule.

5.  Select *Data Replication* \> *Enable Real-Time Data Replication*.

## Results

Real-time replication gets initialized by copying the data from the source. You will see the status *Active* in the *Status* column once real-time replication has been successfully initialized. Whenever data now changes in the source, the changes will be copied into SAP Datasphere. You won't be notified on individual replications. The *Latest Update* column shows date and time when data has been lastly changed in SAP Datasphere.

> ### Note:  
> No logs are generated when data is replicated in real-time mode. The displayed logs relate to previous actions.
