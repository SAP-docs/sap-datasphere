# Remote Tables in Data Access Remote Only Vs Data Access Remote and Replication

An administrator or a data integrator has configured the source connection as *Remote Only* to prevent remote tables from being replicated in SAP Datasphere.

> ### Note:  
> If your connections have been set up in a previous version, they have been updated with data access **.

The possibility to replicate the entire source object using remote table replication \(snapshot or real-time\) is useful for some use cases such as performance optimization.

However, remote table replication offers limited support for use cases that require more flexibility when dealing with larger amounts of data. Many of these use cases require ETL \(Extract, Transform, Load\) capabilities that can be easily achieved with *Replication Flow* or *Data Flow* capabilities.

There are also cases where you don't want the data to be persisted on the Cloud, for example for data protection or security concerns.

To support use cases where data does not need to be replicated using remote tables, the option data access: *Remote Only* can be set to a connection when supported \(currently, for SAP HANA Cloud and SAP HANA on-premise\). For more information, see [SAP HANA Connections](../Integrating-Data-Via-Connections/sap-hana-connections-e6b63f1.md#loioe6b63f176d3640609adcf06297fb37e9). You can use the data access: *Remote Only* for connections that both support remote tables and replication flows. This way, you will replicate data only via replication flows \(SAP recommendation\) and not via remote tables, and thus avoid replicating the same data twice.

The table below compares the actions you can do when your remote table is in data access *Remote Only* compared to a remote table in data access *Remote and Replication* or with no particular option selected:

Possible. You can do it via *Data Replication* \> *Start Data Replication* or *Data Replication* \> *Enable Real-Time Data Replication* when supported. Data can be replicated either from the table editor \(in the *Data Builder*\) or from the *Remote Tables* monitor \(in the *Data Integration Monitor*\)
