# Create a "Hierarchy with Directory" Data Access Control

Users with the *DW Space Administrator* role \(or equivalent privileges\) can create data access controls in which criteria are defined as hierarchy values in a hierarchy with directory. Each user can only see the records that match the hierarchy values she is authorized for in the permissions entity, along with any of their descendants.



<a name="loio44ae6289f96949f48781959f9d284578__section_prerequisites"/>

## Prerequisites

To create data access controls, you must have a scoped role that grants you access to the space with the following privileges:

-   *Data Warehouse General* \(`-R------`\) - To access SAP Datasphere.
-   *Data Warehouse Data Builder* \(`-R------`\) - To access the *Data Builder*.
-   *Data Warehouse Data Access Control* \(`CRUD----`\) - To create, read, update, and delete data access controls.

The *DW Space Administrator* role template, for example, grants these privileges. For more information, see [Privileges and Permissions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/d7350c6823a14733a7a5727bad8371aa.html "A privilege represents a task or an area in SAP Datasphere and can be assigned to a specific role. The actions that can be performed in the area are determined by the permissions assigned to a privilege.") :arrow_upper_right: and [Standard Roles Delivered with SAP Datasphere](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/a50a51d80d5746c9b805a2aacbb7e4ee.html "SAP Datasphere is delivered with several standard roles. A standard role includes a predefined set of privileges and permissions.") :arrow_upper_right:.

## Prepare a Permissions Entity and a Hierarchy with Directory Entity

Before creating your data access control, you must have identified the following entities:

-   An entity with a semantic usage of *Hierarchy with Directory* defining one or more hierarchies that are referenced in the permissions entity records \(see [Create a Hierarchy with Directory](https://help.sap.com/viewer/24f836070a704022a40c15442163e5cf/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/36c39eee184c485a80ebce9d0fec49ec.html "Select a Semantic Usage of Hierarchy with Directory to indicate that your entity contains one or more parent-child hierarchies and has an association to a directory dimension containing a list of the hierarchies.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
-   A permissions entity containing the following columns:
    -   Permission ID column - Which should be marked as a key.
    -   User ID column - Containing user ids in the format required by your identity provider \(email addresses, logon names, or other identifiers\). If you are using SAML authentication, this column must contain values in the form defined as your *User Attribute* / `IdpUserID` \(see [Enabling a Custom SAML Identity Provider](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/9b26536159354aea9024a99cbbe60b4e.html "By default, SAP Cloud Identity Authentication is used by SAP Datasphere. SAP Datasphere also supports single sign-on (SSO), using your identity provider (IdP).") :arrow_upper_right:\). 

        > ### Note:  
        > If a user has no entries in the permissions entity, then they will not have access to any records in the protected view.

    -   Restriction Column - Each restriction per user must have a unique name, and one or more criteria can belong to each restriction. All criteria belonging to a restriction act together as an `AND` condition. If you have more than one restriction per user then all restrictions act together as an `OR` condition.
    -   Root Node Type Column - The node type values used here must be among those specified in the list of *Node Type Values* field in the hierarchy with directory.
    -   Target Node Type Column - The node type values used here must be among those specified in the list of *Node Type Values* in the hierarchy with directory, and each of these node types must be selected via the *Select Node Types* dialog so that all the necessary columns must appear in the list of selected criteria in the data access control.
    -   Hierarchy Identifiers Column - The key values used here must be among those specified in the foreign key columns used in the association from the hierarchy with directory to its directory entity.
    -   Root Values Column - The key values used here must be among those in the node type value columns defined for the given root node type in the hierarchy with directory and, in the case of compound keys, values for each key column must be provided. For example, if a `City` has `City`, `State`, and `Country` key columns then all three values must be provided.

> ### Note:  
> -   Compound keys are separated by a backslash \(`\`\) character.

Based on these three records `bob` will have access to records which meet the following conditions:

-   \(Restriction 0\):
    -   Any `Employee` in the `City` of `Paris\IDF\France` belonging to hierarchy `1\1` and
    -   Any `CostCenter` in the `Organization` `Sales` belonging to hierarchy `1\2`.

-   \(Restriction 1\):
    -   Any `Employee` in the `City` of `Los Angeles\CA\USA` belonging to hierarchy `1\1`.
