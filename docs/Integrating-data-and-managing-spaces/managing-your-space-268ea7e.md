# Managing Your Space

Users with a space administrator role are responsible for controlling user access to their space, and monitoring and otherwise managing the space.

All data acquisition, preparation, and modeling in SAP Datasphere happens inside spaces. A space is a secure area - space data cannot be accessed outside the space unless it is shared to another space or exposed for consumption.

An administrator must create one or more spaces and allocate resources to them. See [Creating Spaces and Allocating Resources](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/2ace657356d54199b0b87d2327b1a70b.html "Users with an administrator role can create spaces and allocate resources to them.") :arrow_upper_right:.

If an administrator has assigned you a space administrator role for a certain space via a scoped role, you can assign other users, and manage other aspects of the space.

To view information on the properties of a space that have been set by an administrator, see:
