# Export Your Space Data

You can export the data contained in your space at any time. For example, you may want to export data before deleting your space.

To export data using the SAP HANA Database Explorer, follow these steps:

1.  Expose for consumption the views containing the data you want to export \(see [Exposing Data For Consumption](https://help.sap.com/viewer/24f836070a704022a40c15442163e5cf/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/40ec77ec24f244279a81448969a7e769.html "Data can only be accessed outside of your SAP Datasphere space if it is exposed for consumption.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
2.  Create a database user in your space \(see [Create a Database User](Integrating-Data-Via-Database-Users/Open-SQL-Schema/create-a-database-user-798e3fd.md)\).

3.  Connect to your Open SQL schema with SAP HANA database explorer \(see [Connect to Your Open SQL Schema](Integrating-Data-Via-Database-Users/Open-SQL-Schema/connect-to-your-open-sql-schema-b78ad20.md)\).

4.  Export the data \(see [Export Schemas, Tables, and Other Catalog Objects](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_COCKPIT/e8d0ddfb84094942a9f90288cd6c05d3/1f20a6c4364c4b0680596e74e4ba281d.html) in the *SAP HANA Database Explorer* guide\).
