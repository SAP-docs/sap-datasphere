# Manage Your Space via the Command Line

You can use the SAP Datasphere command line interface, `datasphere`, to read, update, and delete your space. You can set space properties, assign \(or remove\) users, create database users, create or update objects \(tables, views, and data access controls\), and associate HDI containers to your space.

> ### Note:  
> Relevant only for spaces with a storage type *SAP HANA Database \(Disk and In-Memory\)*, and not for *SAP HANA Data Lake Files* spaces.

To use `datasphere` to manage your space you must have an SAP Datasphere user with the *DW Space Administrator* role or equivalent permissions \(see [Roles and Privileges by App and Feature](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/2d8b7d04dcae402f911d119437ce0a74.html "Review the standard roles and the privileges needed to access apps, tools, and other features of SAP Datasphere.") :arrow_upper_right:\).
