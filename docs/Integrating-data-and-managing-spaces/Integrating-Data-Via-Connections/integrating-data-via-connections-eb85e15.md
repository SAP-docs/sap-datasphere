# Integrating Data via Connections

Users with a space administrator or integrator role can create connections to SAP and non-SAP source systems, including cloud and on-premise systems and partner tools, and to target systems for outbound replication flows. Users with modeler roles can import data via connections for preparation and modeling in SAP Datasphere.



SAP Datasphere delivers predefined connection types where each connection type represents a specific category of remote system, for example SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Cloud, data lake Files, or Google Cloud Storage \(see [Connection Types](connection-types-9456242.md)\).

Each connection type supports:

-   A defined set of properties that applies to the remote system category.

    To connect to a specific remote system, you create a connection based on the corresponding connection type and complete the properties as applicable to your specific remote system and requirements \(see [Create a Connection](create-a-connection-c216584.md)\).

-   A defined set of features in SAP Datasphere \(remote tables, replication flows, data flows, and/or model import\).

    When a feature is enabled in a connection, users with a modeler role can use the connection with the feature, for example to import remote tables from the connected remote system \(see [Features Supported by Connections](features-supported-by-connections-505bf40.md)\).




## Working with Connections

In the <span class="FPA-icons-V3"></span> \(*Connections*\) app, you get an overview of all connections created in your space and use the following tools to create and manage connections:
