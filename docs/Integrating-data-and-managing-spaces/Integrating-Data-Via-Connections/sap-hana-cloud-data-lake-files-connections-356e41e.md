## Context

Standalone SAP HANA Cloud, data lake is a standalone component in the SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit. It is composed of the default data lake Files component and the data lake Relational Engine component, and it is not integrated with SAP HANA database. For more information, see [What is SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_DATA_LAKE/a896c6a184f21015b5bcf4c7a967df07/228c19ac890046ecbe8e38a540c0cb6b.html) in the *SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake* documentation.

> ### Note:  
> -   With connection type *SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake Files* you cannot connect to the SAP HANA Cloud, data lake instance that is available with SAP Datasphere. To connect to this instance, use your Open SQL schema in the space which you have selected to access the data lake.
> 
>     For more information, see [Integrating Data to and From SAP HANA Cloud Data Lake](../Integrating-Data-to-and-From-HANA-Cloud/integrating-data-to-and-from-sap-hana-cloud-data-lake-e84545b.md).
> 
> -   SAP HANA Cloud, data lake Files connections are secure by default. They are encrypted without the need of configuring any TLS settings. Also, uploading server certificates isn't required.
> 
> -   To allow SAP Datasphere to access SAP HANA Cloud, data lake Files storage, it might be required to add the SAP Datasphere outbound IP address and HANA IP addresses to the allowed IP addresses for the data lake instance in SAP HANA Cloud Central.
