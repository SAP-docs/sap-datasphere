# SAP BW Connections

Use an *SAP BW* connection to access data from virtual tables through RFC for ODP sources \(extractors\) and ABAP Dictionary tables from SAP Business Warehouse \(SAP BW\) or SAP BW∕4HANA systems. For SAP BW systems that don't have the ABAP Pipeline Engine extension installed, ODP extractors can be used as sources in data flows.

## Prerequisites

See: [Prepare Connectivity to SAP BW](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/b0b371e1c06546c2b5fd0c22e1b0cdaf.html "To be able to successfully validate and use a connection to SAP BW for remote tables or data flows, certain preparations have to be made.") :arrow_upper_right:



<a name="loioe589041e80264f43b6c209c407336376__section_n34_dcc_x4b"/>

## Using the Connection

The connection type supports the remote table as well as the data flow feature.

> ### Note:  
> If you want to provide SAP BW∕4HANA business semantics to SAP Datasphere, you can use connection type *SAP BW/4HANA Model Import* and import SAP BW∕4HANA models based on analytic queries. During the import, the semantics of the underlying SAP BW∕4HANA models are translated into native SAP Datasphere entities that you can use to access the data stored in SAP BW∕4HANA, to enhance the data in SAP Datasphere, or to consume them by analytic clients. For more information, see [SAP BW∕4HANA Model Transfer Connections](sap-bw-4hana-model-transfer-connections-1caba95.md).

> ### Note:  
> This connection type doesn't support replication flows. Instead, we recommend using the *SAP ABAP* connection type for replication flows.



### Remote Tables

You can use the connection type to access:

-   data from virtual tables through RFC for ODP sources \(extractors\):

    -   Extraction context *ABAP\_CDS* provides access to ABAP Core Data Services \(CDS\) Views that include the annotation `@Analytics.dataextraction.enabled: true`

        For information about which ABAP CDS Views are available for extraction, see [CDS Views Enabled for Data Extraction](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8308e6d301d54584a33cd04a9861bc52/latest/en-US/b7a5b8b72d3643b7a8ecf4cd695e0791.html) in the *SAP S/4HANA* documentation.

    -   Extraction context *BW* provides access to InfoProviders in SAP BW or SAP BW∕4HANA systems:

        -   DataStore objects \(advanced or classic\)

        -   CompositeProviders

        -   Queries as InfoProviders \(with a subset of OLAP capabilities\) - can be enabled in the runtime properties of queries in the BW Modeling tools

        -   InfoObjects \(characteristics\) - can be enabled in the general settings of the InfoObject editor in the BW Modeling tools


    -   Extraction context *SAPI* provides access to Service API \(SAPI\) DataSources

        > ### Note:  
        > Importing SAPI DataSources into SAP Datasphere is not supported if the DataSource contains mandatory selection fields. You will receive an error message when trying to import tables for such DataSources.


-   data from SAP ABAP Dictionary tables in SAP S/4HANA systems


Supported data access methods for remote tables:

-   Remote
-   Replication \(snapshot\)
-   For ODP sources: Replication \(real-time\)

    For more information about the prerequisites, see [Replicate Data Changes in Real-Time](../Data-Integration-Monitor/replicate-data-changes-in-real-time-441d327.md).


For more information, see [Replicating Data and Monitoring Remote Tables](../Data-Integration-Monitor/replicating-data-and-monitoring-remote-tables-4dd95d7.md). 

> ### Note:  
> Certain SAPI DataSources \(from FI-AA Business Content, for example\) may send duplicate records during snapshot replication or real-time initialization. Remote table replication runs with optimized INSERT processing on DataSource key level which leads to unique constraint violation errors. In such cases we recommend to use a data flow which uses the remote table as source and for which the target table has selected the *Append* mode with the *Update Records By Primary Key \(UPSERT\)* option.



### Data Flows

For legacy SAP BW systems that do not have the ABAP Pipeline Engine extension or DMIS Addon installed, you can leverage Operational Data Provisioning \(ODP\) connectivity und use ODP extractors as sources in data flows. Note that ABAP Dictionary tables are not supported as sources in data flows.

> ### Note:  
> The data preview in the data flow editor of the Data Builder is **not** available for SAP BW sources.





### Best Practices for Integrating Data

See [SAP Data Warehouse Cloud - First Guidance: Data Integration for ABAP Source Systems](https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/06/e8238e12-e47d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html) \(published February 2022\) for general best practices for integrating data from ABAP source systems with SAP Datasphere.
