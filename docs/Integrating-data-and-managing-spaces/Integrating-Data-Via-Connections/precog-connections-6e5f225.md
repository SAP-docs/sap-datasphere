# Precog Connections

Extend connectivity beyond SAP Datasphere standard remote connectivity and cover additional data sources that are available with Precog. 

Precog provides connectivity to a variety of data sources, including marketing data sources, databases and others.

When creating a connection to a partner tool, an Open SQL schema is generated in SAP Datasphere. To be able to send data to the Open SQL schema, the IP addresses of the partner tool need to be added to the SAP Datasphere IP allowlist, and during connection creation the partner tool on their side needs to establish a connection to the schema.

For more information, see:
