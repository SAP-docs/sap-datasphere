Remote Tables

</td>
<td valign="top">

You can use remote tables imported from the connection either to access data directly live in the connected source \(federation\) or to copy the data into SAP Datasphere \(replication\).

You can access the following data:

-   for federation: standard and custom CDS view entities that are exposed using the ABAP SQL service from SAP S/4HANA Cloud \(**recommended for federation scenarios**\)

    For more information, see [Using ABAP SQL Services for Accessing Data from SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/ef2b2238154f4cd78a08df360447c1d5.html "The ABAP SQL service provides SQL-level access to published CDS view entities for SAP Datasphere. You can use the service to replicate data with replication flows or to federate data with remote tables.") :arrow_upper_right:.

    > ### Note:  
    > On the *Sources* tab of the remote-table-related Data Builder editors in SAP Datasphere, the service binding name from the *SQL\_SCHEMA* authorization field is visible as \(virtual\) schema.

-   for federation and replication: ABAP CDS Views exposed as OData services for data extraction. Data is accessed via Cloud Data Integration \(**legacy**\)

    > ### Note:  
    > This legacy option is still supported, however we recommend using the ABAP SQL service for federation \(if available\) and replication flows for replication.

    For remote tables, real-time replication is supported. For information about any constraints, see [Replicate Data Changes in Real-Time](../Data-Integration-Monitor/replicate-data-changes-in-real-time-441d327.md).

You can use the connection to import semantically-rich entities from SAP S/4HANA Cloud and all their sources and dependencies. For more information, see [Importing Entities with Semantics from SAP S/4HANA](https://help.sap.com/viewer/24f836070a704022a40c15442163e5cf/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/845fedbd28574aa8b84239df848936f6.html "You can use the Import Entities wizard to load metadata from your SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP S/4HANA on-premise connections via semantically-rich objects.

Data Flows

</td>
<td valign="top">

You can use the connection to add source objects to a data flow.

You can access the following data:

-   extraction-enabled ABAP CDS views that are C1-released, that is views with annotation `@Analytics.dataextraction.enabled: true` and that are available in the connected system \(access via ABAP Pipeline Engine\)

    For more information, see:

> ### Note:

> ### Note:  
> The connection type supports replication with both remote tables via Data Provisioning Agent \(SAP HANA Smart Data Integration\) and replication flows.
> 
> Regardless of whether you use the same connection or two separate connections, for replicating data from a dedicated source object in the source we strongly recommend to only use remote tables or replication flows and not both. Generally, for replication scenarios, we recommend to use replication flows.
