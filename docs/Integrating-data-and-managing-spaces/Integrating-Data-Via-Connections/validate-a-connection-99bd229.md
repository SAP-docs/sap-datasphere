## Prerequisites

To create, edit, validate, or delete a connection, you must have a scoped role that grants you access to a space with the following privileges:

-   *Data Warehouse General* \(`-R------`\) - To access SAP Datasphere.
-   *Data Warehouse Connection* \(`CRUD----`\) - To create, edit, validate, or delete a connection.
-   *Spaces Files* \(`CRUD----`\) - To create, read, update, and delete objects in your spaces.

The *DW Space Administrator* and *DW Integrator* role templates, for example, grant these privileges.
