# Delete a Connection

Select one or more connections and delete them if they are not used.

1.  In the side navigation area, click <span class="FPA-icons-V3">î›Š</span> \(*Connections*\) and select a space if necessary.

2.  Select one or more connections and click *Delete*.


If the connection is still used for accessing data via remote tables, for importing models, or for data flows or replication flows, you cannot delete it. A message informs you of any dependent objects.
