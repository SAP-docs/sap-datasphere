Remote Tables

</td>
<td valign="top">

You can use remote tables imported from the connection either to access data directly live in the connected source \(federation\) or to copy the data into SAP Datasphere \(replication\).

For remote tables, real-time replication is supported. For information about any constraints, see [Replicate Data Changes in Real-Time](../Data-Integration-Monitor/replicate-data-changes-in-real-time-441d327.md).

</td>

Data Flows

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Replication Flows

</td>
<td valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> ### Note:  
> The connection type supports replication with both remote tables via Data Provisioning Agent \(SAP HANA Smart Data Integration\) and replication flows.
> 
> Regardless of whether you use the same connection or two separate connections, for replicating data from a dedicated source object in the source we strongly recommend to only use remote tables or replication flows and not both.

> ### Note:  
> When creating a connection to SAP HANA on-premise using SAP HANA smart data access via Cloud Connector, the system checks for a required internal service. In the connection overview, a warning icon indicates that the service might not be ready yet. This happens for the first connection you create or when you create a connection after the service has been disabled \(after an automated weekly check returning that there is no such connection anymore\). Getting the service ready might take up to 45 minutes. Validate the connection and check the message details for more information.
