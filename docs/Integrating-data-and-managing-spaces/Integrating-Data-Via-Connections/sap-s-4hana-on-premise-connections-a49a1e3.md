Remote Tables

</td>
<td valign="top">

You can use remote tables imported from the connection either to access data directly live in the connected source \(federation\) or to copy the data into SAP Datasphere \(replication\).

You can access the following data:

-   for federation: standard and custom CDS view entities that are exposed using the ABAP SQL service from SAP S/4HANA \(**recommended for federation scenarios**\)

    For more information, see [Using ABAP SQL Services for Accessing Data from SAP S/4HANA](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/4d7474595a5b41bb986616262ff44a3a.html "The ABAP SQL service provides SQL-level access to published CDS view entities for SAP Datasphere. You can use the service to federate data with remote tables. Using the service requires Cloud Connector.") :arrow_upper_right:.

    > ### Note:  
    > On the *Sources* tab of the remote-table-related Data Builder editors in SAP Datasphere, the service binding name from the *SQL\_SCHEMA* authorization field is visible as \(virtual\) schema.

-   for federation and replication: \(**legacy**\)

    -   Data from virtual tables through RFC for ODP sources \(extractors\):

        -   Extraction context *ABAP\_CDS* provides access to ABAP Core Data Services \(CDS\) Views that include the annotation `@Analytics.dataextraction.enabled: true`

            For information about which ABAP CDS Views are available for extraction, see [CDS Views Enabled for Data Extraction](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8308e6d301d54584a33cd04a9861bc52/latest/en-US/b7a5b8b72d3643b7a8ecf4cd695e0791.html) in the *SAP S/4HANA* documentation.

            > ### Note:  
            > ABAP CDS Views are the preferred method over SAPI extractors when integrating SAP S/4HANA data with SAP Datasphere.

        -   Extraction context *BW* provides access to InfoProviders in SAP BW or SAP BWâˆ•4HANA systems:

            -   DataStore objects \(advanced or classic\)

            -   CompositeProviders

            -   Queries as InfoProviders \(with a subset of OLAP capabilities\) - can be enabled in the runtime properties of queries in the BW Modeling tools

            -   InfoObjects \(characteristics\) - can be enabled in the general settings of the InfoObject editor in the BW Modeling tools


        -   Extraction context *SAPI* provides access to Service API \(SAPI\) DataSources

            > ### Note:  
            > Importing SAPI DataSources into SAP Datasphere is not supported if the DataSource contains mandatory selection fields. You will receive an error message when trying to import tables for such DataSources.

            > ### Note:  
            > Certain SAPI DataSources \(from FI-AA Business Content, for example\) may send duplicate records during snapshot replication or real-time initialization. Remote table replication runs with optimized INSERT processing on DataSource key level which leads to unique constraint violation errors. In such cases, we recommend to use a data flow which uses the remote table as source and for which the target table has selected the *Append* mode with the *Update Records By Primary Key \(UPSERT\)* option.


    -   Data from SAP ABAP Dictionary tables in SAP S/4HANA systems


    Real-time replication is supported for ODP sources. For information about any constraints, see [Replicate Data Changes in Real-Time](../Data-Integration-Monitor/replicate-data-changes-in-real-time-441d327.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > This legacy option is still supported, however we recommend using the ABAP SQL service for federation \(if available\) and replication flows for replication.

You can import extraction-enabled ABAP CDS views that are C1-released, that is views with annotation `@Analytics.dataextraction.enabled: true` and that are available in the connected system. For more information, see [CDS Views Enabled for Data Extraction](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/ee6ff9b281d8448f96b4fe6c89f2bdc8/b7a5b8b72d3643b7a8ecf4cd695e0791.html) in the *SAP S/4HANA* documentation.

The options to access the data depend on the version of the SAP S/4HANA system. You can see the data access option when you have selected a connection in the *Import Entities* wizard:

-   *Replication Flow to Local Tables* - available if the connected system is SAP S/4HANA 2021 or higher \(SAP\_BASIS 756 and higher\). It's the default and recommended option for these system versions.

-   *Remote Tables* - available if the connected system is SAP S/4HANA 1809 or higher \(SAP\_BASIS 753 and higher\)

    In the *Import Entities* wizard, you can change from the default *Replication Flow to Local Tables* to *Remote Tables* if your system is SAP S/4HANA 2021 or higher \(SAP\_BASIS 756 and higher\).


> ### Note:

You can use the connection to add source objects to a data flow.

You can replicate the following data:

-   extraction-enabled ABAP CDS views that are C1-released, that is views with annotation `@Analytics.dataextraction.enabled: true` and that are available in the connected system \(access via ABAP Pipeline Engine\)

    For more information, see [CDS Views Enabled for Data Extraction](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/ee6ff9b281d8448f96b4fe6c89f2bdc8/b7a5b8b72d3643b7a8ecf4cd695e0791.html) in the *SAP S/4HANA* documentation.

-   Tables from SAP Landscape Transformation Replication Server \(SAP LT Replication Server\) sources, for which an appropriate configuration has been created in SAP LT Replication Server.


> ### Note:  
> -   The availability of the data flow feature depends on the used version and Support Package level of SAP S/4HANA or the DMIS addon in the source. Make sure your source systems meet the required minimum versions. We recommend to use the latest available version of SAP S/4HANA and the DMIS add-on where possible and have the latest SAP notes and TCI notes implemented in your systems.
> 
>     For more information about required versions, recommended system landscape, considerations for the supported source objects, and more, see SAP Note [2890171](https://me.sap.com/notes/2890171).

*Fast Serialization*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Turn on RFC fast serialization to help improve replication flow performance by avoiding unnecessary, costly conversions in ABAP. This can be useful particularly in cases of large data volumes. The default is *On*.

> ### Note:  
> -   Fast serialization has no impacts on data flows.
> 
> -   *Fast Serialization* for replication flows is not related to *RFC Serialization* in the advanced properties of connections using a Data Provisioning Agent for remote tables.
> 
> -   For information about the prerequisites for using fast serialization in SAP Datasphere, see [Prepare Connectivity to SAP S/4HANA On-Premise](https://help.sap.com/viewer/935116dd7c324355803d4b85809cec97/DEV_CURRENT/en-US/8de01dd25c1e443e8e2de7d2fbe1364d.html "To be able to successfully validate and use a connection to SAP S/4HANA, certain preparations have to be made.") :arrow_upper_right:.

>     Use the connection validation to check if the prerequisites in the source system for using fast serialization are met.

## Advanced Connection Properties

When you've selected a Data Provisioning Agent, you can configure advanced connection properties to enable specific customer scenarios. In the connection creation wizard, you configure advanced properties in an additional wizard step. When editing the connection to configure the properties, scroll down and click the *Show Advanced Properties button*. Advanced properties have default values that you can override according to your customer scenarioâ€™s needs.

Available properties:

-   *Connection Pool Size*

-   *Connection Limit*

-   *Extractorâ€™s ODP Version*

-   *CDC Batch Size, MB*

-   *RFC Unicode*

-   \[if *RFC Unicode* = *No*\] *RFC Character Encoding*

-   *SNC Mode*

-   \[if *SNC Mode* = *On*\] *SNC Library*

-   \[if *SNC Mode* = *On*\] *SNC Name of Client*

-   \[if *SNC Mode* = *On*\] *SNC Name of SAP Server*

-   \[if *SNC Mode* = *On*\] *SNC SSO*

-   \[if *SNC Mode* = *On*\] *SNC Quality of Protection*

-   *RFC Serialization* \(requires Data Provisioning Agent version 2.3.7.2 or higher\)

-   \[if *Streaming Read* = *On*\] *Batch Size, MB*

-   \[if *Streaming Read* = *On*\] *Batch Receive Timeout*

-   \[if *Streaming Read* = *On*\] *RFC Trace*
