You can use remote tables imported from the connection either to access data directly live in the connected source \(federation\) or to copy the data into SAP Datasphere \(snapshot replication\).

\[optional\] Enter an additional location. By default, SAP Datasphere connects to BigQuery datasets only from Google's default location - `US`. Datasets from any other location will only be available in the*Data Builder* if you enter the additional location here. 

A location can be a region, for example `us-west1`or `asia-east1`, or a multi-region, for example `EU`.
