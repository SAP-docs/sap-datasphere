# Add a Connection to a System in Unified Customer Landscape to the Space

For systems that are integrated with SAP Datasphere in the Unified Customer Landscape of SAP BTP, connections are generated in SAP Datasphere when creating a formation. These generated connections are not assigned to any space yet. If an administrator in the *Configuration* tool has allowed the connection to be added to your space, users with an integrator role can add the connection to the space in the *Connections* app.
