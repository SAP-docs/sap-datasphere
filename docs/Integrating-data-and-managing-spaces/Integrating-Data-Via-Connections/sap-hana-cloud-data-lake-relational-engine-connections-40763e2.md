# SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake Relational Engine Connections

Use an *SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake Relational Engine* connection to access table data from the Relational Engine component of a standalone SAP HANA Cloud, data lake.

> ### Note:  
> The connection type is not supported in spaces with storage type *SAP HANA Data Lake Files* \(file spaces\).

Standalone SAP HANA Cloud, data lake is a standalone component in the SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit. It is composed of the default data lake Files component and the data lake Relational Engine component, and it is not integrated with SAP HANA database. For more information, see [What is SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_DATA_LAKE/a896c6a184f21015b5bcf4c7a967df07/228c19ac890046ecbe8e38a540c0cb6b.html) in the *SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake* documentation.

You can use remote tables imported from the connection either to access data directly live in the connected source \(federation\) or to copy the data into SAP Datasphere \(replication\).For more information, see [Replicating Data and Monitoring Remote Tables](../Data-Integration-Monitor/replicating-data-and-monitoring-remote-tables-4dd95d7.md).

> ### Note:  
> -   With connection type *SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake Relational Engine* you cannot connect to the SAP HANA Cloud, data lake instance that is available with SAP Datasphere. To connect to this instance, use your Open SQL schema in the space which you have selected to access the data lake.

> -   SAP HANA Cloud, data lake Relational Engine connections are secure by default. They are encrypted without the need of configuring any TLS settings. Also, uploading server certificates isn't required.

The remote system often decides whether an external client, such as SAP Datasphere, can access it based on allowlisted IPs. You must add SAP Datasphere's IP address to the remote system's allowlist before SAP Datasphere attempts access, via connections, for example.") :arrow_upper_right:
