# SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake Relational Engine Connections

Use an *SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake Relational Engine* connection to access table data from the Relational Engine component of a standalone SAP HANA Cloud, data lake.

Standalone SAP HANA Cloud, data lake is a standalone component in the SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit. It is composed of the default data lake Files component and the data lake Relational Engine component, and it is not integrated with SAP HANA database. For more information, see [What is SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_DATA_LAKE/a896c6a184f21015b5bcf4c7a967df07/228c19ac890046ecbe8e38a540c0cb6b.html) in the *SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake* documentation.

## Using the Connection

The connection type supports the remote table as well as the data flow feature.

Supported data access methods for remote tables:

-   Remote
-   Replication \(snapshot\)

> ### Note:  
> -   With connection type *SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake Relational Engine* you cannot connect to the SAP HANA Cloud, data lake instance that is available with SAP Datasphere. To connect to this instance, use your Open SQL schema in the space which you have selected to access the data lake.

> 
> -   SAP HANA Cloud, data lake Relational Engine connections are secure by default. They are encrypted without the need of configuring any TLS settings. Also, uploading server certificates isn't required.
> 
> -   To allow SAP Datasphere to access SAP HANA Cloud, data lake Relational Engine, it might be required to add the SAP Datasphere outbound IP address and HANA IP addresses to the allowed IP addresses for the data lake instance in SAP HANA Cloud Central.
